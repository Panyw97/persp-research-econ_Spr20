conjunction with the more detailed information and financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus in addition to this summary we urge you to read the entire prospectus carefully especially the risks of investing in our adss discussed under 147 risk factors 148 before deciding whether to invest in our adss this prospectus contains information from an industry report commissioned by us and prepared by frost amp sullivan an independent research firm to provide information regarding our industry and our market position we refer to this report as the frost amp sullivan report overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery development and commercialization of novel or highly differentiated biologics to treat diseases with significant unmet medical needs particularly cancers and autoimmune disorders we were founded to capture the opportunities presented by the confluence of two major developments 151 the emergence of an attractive and growing biologics market in china and the revolutionary scientific breakthroughs in cancer and autoimmune disease medicines we believe we are well positioned to become a biotech leader in china because of our innovative discovery expertise fit for purpose technology platforms biomarker enabled translational medicine capabilities and clinical development capabilities these integrated capabilities are further enhanced by our deep understanding of china 146 s biologics regulatory framework and our direct access to extensive pre clinical and clinical trial resources in china to date we have developed an innovative pipeline of more than 10 clinical and pre clinical stage assets through our internal research and development efforts and in licensing arrangements with global pharmaceutical and biotech companies commercial opportunities in china and our unique position we are fully aware of the competitive and regulatory challenges we face as an innovative clinical stage biotech company based in china including need to raise significant capital significant competition from global and other china based biopharmaceutical companies less streamlined regulatory pathway compared to countries with long established regulatory systems and potential implementation challenges and uncertainties of the recent government reform of the drug approval system however with these challenges in mind we have been mitigating the risks through our internal r amp d system that integrates multi functional aspects of our drug development process to proactively deal with some of the regulatory challenges mentioned above furthermore through our beijing office which focuses on regulatory matters we have established an effective communication channel with the regulatory agencies to discuss and resolve various regulatory issues promptly and effectively we see vast opportunities for immuno oncology and autoimmune biologics therapies in china first both the incidence and mortality of cancers in china have been increasing in recent years and are outpacing those in the united states and the rest of the world second many innovative biologics approved to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases in the united states and europe are not yet available in china third the chinese government has implemented new policies and regulations to simplify the review and approval cycle of clinical trials and new drug applications to encourage biologics innovation fourth there has been a continuous and rapid increase in personal disposable income in china coupled with ongoing improvement in basic national health insurance coverage making innovative biologics more accessible to more chinese patients according to the frost amp sullivan report china 146 s biologics market is growing faster than the global biologics market and is expected to reach approximately rmb1 3 trillion us 181 9 billion by 2030 in terms of sales revenue we believe we are uniquely positioned as a china based global player to tap into these vast commercial opportunities this is best demonstrated by our short journey in becoming one of the top clinical stage immunology companies in china according to the frost amp sullivan report we are ranked as top clinical stage china based immunology companies as measured by the innovative quality and number of investigational table of contents drugs and drug candidates under clinical and pre clinical development in our pipeline amount of pre ipo financing raised in excess of us 400 million in three years pre ipo valuation and recognition and awards earned in the biotech industry for example in 2018 and 2019 we are the only china based biotech company recognized by genetic engineering amp biotechnology news gen as a top 10 immuno oncology start up in the world to date our research and development capabilities encompass discovery translational medicine biologics cmc development pre clinical development and clinical development with footprints in shanghai beijing and the united states we are now at a critical juncture to transition from a clinical stage biotech company into a fully integrated end to end global biopharmaceutical company in the next few years our unique business model to achieve our mission and capitalize on these commercial opportunities we have developed a business model built on two pillars a fast to market china strategy and a fast to poc proof of concept global strategy fast to market china strategy our fast to market china strategy focuses on seeking opportunities to in license the development and commercialization rights of investigational drugs from global biopharmaceutical companies for greater china we only select investigational drugs that have the potential to become novel or highly differentiated medicines through our substantial in house research and development efforts we build additional data packages to meet the requirements of the national medical products administration the 147 nmpa 148 to ensure programs are ready for late stage or registrational clinical development our internal development capabilities combined with our deep insight into china 146 s regulatory framework and our clinical network enable us to efficiently navigate through the drug development process to registration to date we have built an innovative china portfolio consisting of five investigational drugs with an aim for near term product launch all of these investigational drugs have met the related pre set safety and preliminary efficacy endpoints in phase 1 or phase 2 clinical trials in europe the united states or elsewhere and are either in or ready for phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials in china tj202 is undergoing two registrational trials including a third line monotherapy trial and a second line combination therapy trial in multiple myeloma in greater china in addition we submitted an ind application to the nmpa in october 2019 for a phase 1b trial for tj202 in systemic lupus erythematosus 147 sle 148 for tj101 we are working towards submitting an ind application in 2020 for a phase 3 registrational trial in china for enoblituzumab we expect to submit an ind application in 2020 for a registrational trial or a phase 2 trial as a result the investigational drugs in our china portfolio are positioned for a series of new drug applications ndas in china with the submission of the first nda expected in 2021 fast to poc global strategy our fast to poc global strategy focuses on advancing our own novel or differentiated biologics towards clinical validation in the united states first we seek poc of these drug candidates in the united states by conducting early phase clinical trials with a set of safety and efficacy endpoints and leveraging the fda 146 s streamlined regulatory system for innovative drug development including a predictable timeline towards ind approval second we will use the data generated to advance clinical development in china which we believe confers several advantages including access to china 146 s large patient pool extensive clinical trial resources through collaborations with leading hospitals in china and a regulatory pathway for fast track approval of drugs supported by solid overseas clinical data building on this approach we may out license the global rights excluding greater china of these investigational drugs following clinical validation in the united states while retaining the greater china rights for further development and commercialization we believe this approach will allow chinese patients to benefit from our most advanced treatments concurrently or soon after their market approvals elsewhere to date we have created a global portfolio that consists of two molecular classes 151 monoclonal antibodies and bi specific antibodies which are internally generated they are highly innovative molecules compared to global competitor assets in the same or related classes of drug candidates three investigational drugs in our global portfolio tjm2 tjc4 and tjd5 are in phase 1 trials in the united states having obtained ind approvals from the nmpa for tjc4 tjd5 and tjm2 we have initiated a phase 1 trial for tjc4 and expect to initiate phase 1 trials for tjd5 and tjm2 in china in early 2020 table of contents these two strategies and the resulting two portfolios complement each other this enables us to achieve a balance among our ambition to develop novel or highly differentiated drugs our goal to efficiently advance our pipeline assets towards commercialization and the inherent development risks with this goal in mind we are also aware that the intended novelty and key differentiation of our investigational drugs or drug candidates are subject to pivotal clinical validation and approval by the relevant regulatory authorities there is no assurance that any such investigational drug or drug candidate will receive regulatory approval see 147 risk factors 148 for a detailed description of the risks related to the development and commercialization of our drug candidates our capabilities our innovative discovery expertise built by an elite group of seasoned immunologists with extensive academic research and drug development experience our discovery engine has generated a panel of internally developed innovative drug molecules in a short span of four years among them 11 innovative drug molecules have met our standard of novelty or high differentiation and have advanced toward further development this achievement is a testament to our discovery team 146 s acumen and technical prowess in translating target biology into points of innovation or differentiation the discovery of tjc4 showcases our innovative research capabilities not settling on performing routine or traditional antibody screening we set a specific goal to identify and select a unique cd47 antibody that is free from binding to red blood cells rbc from all cd47 antibody leads as a result we selected by design our proprietary cd47 antibody tjc4 with a rare epitope that uniquely spares binding to rbcs as a differentiation point from other cd47 antibodies that typically cause inherent hematologic side effects having confirmed the rbc sparing property in a series of in vitro assays as well as multiple monkey studies we are conducting a phase 1 clinical trial for tjc4 in the united states another example of our r amp d capability relates to our novel bi specific antibody panel that represents a new wave of oncology drug candidates we created novel biological properties of these bi specific antibodies that are capable of enriching immune cells in tumors through dual targeting of pd l1 and immune cells for a synergistic anti tumor effect these bi specific drug candidates have been shown to exhibit unique properties that render tumors more responsive to treatment our discovery expertise when combined with our 147 fit for purpose 148 antibody engineering technology platforms becomes a powerful engine of innovation to create novel molecules our fit for purpose technology platforms our proprietary antibody engineering platforms enable us to accurately capture the biological properties of bi specific antibodies and retain good manufacturability and druggability of the molecules to date we have created seven novel pre clinical stage bi specific drug molecules in addition to our own ig scfv bi specific antibody platform we partnered with abl bio and wuxi biologics to access their antibody engineering platforms in order to increase the probability of success as different molecular configurations require different technologies furthermore our proprietary antibody cytokine technology has enabled another form of bi specific antibodies such as tj l1i7 and tj c4gm that link a tumor engaging antibody with an immuno modulatory cytokine superior to monoclonal antibodies or cytokines alone this class of bi specific antibodies has demonstrated unique properties capable of concentrating the drug molecules in tumors for a desired target effect with reduced systemic toxicity of cytokines or creating biologic synergy that can potentially translate into better treatment outcome our biomarker enabled translational medicine capabilities as we focus on developing innovative drug molecules the ability to apply relevant biomarkers that link a drug response to treatment effects is critical for early stage clinical trials of our investigational drugs this translational medicine capability requires cross functional knowledge and unique skills to link the target biology of an investigational drug to clinical responses we have been developing tailor made biomarkers for each of our investigational drugs which are used to select potential responders predict and measure target table of contents engagement support dose determination and enable timely informed decisions on advancing our assets to the next phase of clinical development for example for the development of tjd5 we intend to use cd73 in tumor tissue in combination with other tumor biomarkers to stratify potential target patient populations in our clinical trial to that end we have developed assays to measure cd73 expression and activity in tumor tissues furthermore we have developed specialized assays to measure tjd5 drug concentrations in tumor tissues by linking drug concentration with its activity in the same tumor location these data help us determine appropriate dose selection for further clinical studies our clinical development capabilities our clinical development is led by a global team of clinical scientists industry physicians and experts in portfolio management quantitative science clinical operations drug safety and quality control our clinical team accounts for approximately 80 of our entire r amp d organization 146 s headcount and 80 of our budget allocation the skillset of our clinical development team is highlighted by a combination of extensive global pharma local drug development and operation experiences with clinical networks in china and the united states the team is driven by high ethical standards with passion for improving the lives of patients our team has the ability to integrate internal core development functions to conduct global and local clinical trials we also effectively leverage external resources including clinical contract research organizations academic clinical centers and or networks and global pharmaceutical or biotech partnerships furthermore we have established and implemented a robust internal clinical governance system and processes to safeguard patient safety and data integrity our current clinical development functions and teams are strategically based in shanghai beijing and the united states to cover phase 1 through phase 3 clinical trials in china and early stage clinical trials in the united states our clinical development capabilities are best demonstrated by the rapid implementation of eight ongoing clinical trials including five phase 1 2 and registrational trials in greater china and three phase 1 trials in the united states within the past three years to ensure regulatory approval and subsequent product launch as currently planned we strive to reach the following critical clinical milestones by the end of 2020 11 active clinical programs consisting of two phase 3 or registrational trials in china two phase 2 trials in china and seven phase 1 trials in the united states and china our global strategic collaborations we have established an excellent track record of in licensing and out licensing deals with our global and regional partners these in licensing deals enable us to acquire multiple innovative clinical stage assets with favorable clinical data packages we have quickly built our china portfolio through in licensing deals with global biotech partners including morphosys genexine macrogenics and ferring as the sublicensee under our agreement with ferring related to olamkicept tj301 over the past three years we have established more than 10 global and regional partnerships with reputable pharma or biotech companies our partners selected us among many china based companies with the belief that we are an ideal partner in china given our strength in science and drug development capability our outstanding track record of execution of rapidly progressing drug development programs in china and the united states and our vision and network to tap into business opportunities and the growing pharmaceutical market in china for example morphosys macrogenics and genexine all stated that we are an ideal or the best partner in china in their press releases or public announcements the out licensing deals enable us to streamline our pipeline and focus our resources on the most valuable assets in addition we seek co development opportunities to share development costs and risks and territorial commercial rights with our partners in the past two years we have out licensed three de prioritized assets and initiated four co development programs with partners such as abl bio and wuxi biologics the revenue from out licensing and co development deals is expected to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses table of contents our drug pipeline the chart below summarizes the development status of our drug pipeline i for tj202 it has two ongoing registrational trials a monotherapy trial and a combination therapy trial in multiple myeloma in greater china and we expect to initiate a phase 1b trial in systemic lupus erythematosus 147 sle 148 in 2020 ii for tj101 we are working towards submitting an ind application in 2020 for a phase 3 registrational trial in china and iii for enoblituzumab we expect to submit an ind application in 2020 for a registrational trial or a phase 2 trial we were collaborating with everest medicines limited 147 everest 148 to co develop and commercialize tj202 in greater china for all indications in hematologic oncology everest was primarily responsible for sharing with us by the proportion of 75 for everest and 25 for us the development costs of tj202 on november 4 2019 we and everest terminated the collaboration agreement including all the supplements and amendments thereto with respect to the co development and commercialization of tj202 in greater china upon the termination everest will not retain any rights or entitlements to develop or commercialize tj202 or any economic interest in its commercialization all intellectual property rights in respect of tj202 arising from its development under the collaboration agreement are vested and owned by us and we hold all intellectual property rights and have maximum flexibility to further develop manufacture and commercialize tj202 in greater china in consideration of the above arrangements we will issue a total value of us 37 0 million of ordinary shares the 147 cpp shares 148 to everest representing everest 146 s historical contribution to our collaboration and the associated time cost the cpp shares will be issued concurrently with and subject to the completion of this offering within 180 days from termination of the collaboration agreement at a per share price equal to the initial public offering price adjusted to reflect the ads to ordinary share ratio in the event that this offering has not been completed within 180 days from the termination of the collaboration agreement we will issue 4 762 751 ordinary shares to everest on the 181st day see also 147 the offering 151 concurrent private placement 148 for more details our bi specific antibody panel consists of i four pd l1 based bi specific antibodies including tj l1c4 pd l1 and cd47 tj l1h3 pd l1 and b7 h3 tj l14b pd l1 and 4 1bb and tj l1i7 anti pd l1 and il 7 cytokine fusion ii tj c4gm anti cd47 and gm csf cytokine fusion and iii tj cldn4b claudin 18 2 and 4 1bb highlights of our fast to market china portfolio our fast to market china strategy is demonstrated by our china portfolio which consists of novel or highly differentiated investigational drugs tj202 tj107 enoblituzumab and tj101 are the four anchor assets in our china portfolio while we have been diligently pursuing our fast to market china strategy we are aware that there is no assurance that we will always be successful in commercializing any of our product candidates in our table of contents china portfolio in an accelerated manner see 147 risk factors 148 for a detailed description of the risks related to the development and commercialization of our drug candidates tj202 is a differentiated cd38 antibody originally developed by morphosys that meets the pre set clinical safety and preliminary efficacy endpoints from a clinical trial conducted in the european union eu in licensed from morphosys tj202 is being developed to address the current unmet needs and commercial opportunities in china for multiple myeloma and potentially autoimmune diseases such as sle we own an exclusive license to develop tj202 in greater china we believe tj202 if approved is potentially highly differentiated compared with the currently marketed cd38 antibody first under a similar pre medication condition with dexamethasone anti pyretics and anti histamines tj202 has demonstrated a significantly shorter infusion time and lower infusion reaction rate second unlike the currently marketed cd38 antibody tj202 does not down regulate cd38 expression on the surface of bone marrow myeloma cells in vitro maintaining sensitivity of myeloma cells to tj202 for repeated treatments tj202 is undergoing a registrational trial as a third line monotherapy and a registrational trial in combination with lenalidomide as a second line therapy both in patients with multiple myeloma in greater china we aim to submit an nda for tj202 as a third line monotherapy in 2021 followed by another nda submission for tj202 as a second line combination therapy moreover we believe tj202 has great market potential in the treatment of pathogenic antibody mediated autoimmune diseases such as sle where there is a significant unmet need for more effective therapies additionally we submitted an ind application to the nmpa in october 2019 for a phase 1b trial for tj202 in sle tj107 is the first long acting recombinant human il 7 known to boost cancer fighting t lymphocytes by increasing their number and function and is being developed as a potential oncology investigational drug the clinical safety and effect of tj107 on t cells have been investigated in multiple previous and ongoing clinical trials in south korea and the united states tj107 is being positioned to address a huge unmet medical need in oncology first tj107 can be an oncology care agent to treat cancer treatment related lymphopenia low blood lymphocyte levels a common condition that occurs in cancer patients who have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy and there is no approved treatment for this condition according to the frost amp sullivan report in greater china the incidence of lymphopenia reached 1 5 million in 2018 and is estimated to increase to 1 7 million in 2023 and further to 2 0 million in 2030 this condition causes further damage to patients 146 already compromised immune system and weakens its ability to fight cancers second tj107 has been shown to synergize with a pd 1 antibody in a tumor animal model potentially through increased t lymphocyte activation and proliferation we are conducting a phase 1b trial in china to determine a suitable dose range for subsequent trials we expect to start a phase 2 trial in cancer patients in 2020 we are coordinating our study globally with genexine which is conducting a phase 2 clinical trial in south korea and parallel clinical trials in the united states towards clinical poc enoblituzumab is a humanized antibody directed at b7 h3 a member of the b7 family of t cell checkpoint regulators that is widely expressed across multiple tumor types and plays a key role in the regulation of immune response against cancers similar to other inhibitors of the b7 family such as pd l1 targeting b7 h3 potentially provides a treatment option for a variety of cancers expressing b7 h3 enoblituzumab was originally developed by macrogenics and we own the greater china rights of this investigational drug in multiple clinical trials conducted by macrogenics when combined with pembrolizumab in recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 147 scchn 148 and non small cell lung cancer 147 nsclc 148 enoblituzumab has shown favorable clinical results that warrant further investigation we expect to submit an ind application in 2020 for a registrational trial or a phase 2 trial further clinical development is being planned together with macrogenics to extend to other cancer indications in china and globally tj101 if approved is a potential highly differentiated long acting human growth hormone that is being developed as a weekly treatment for pediatric growth hormone deficiency as compared to currently available daily regimens of recombinant human growth hormone rhgh tj101 was originally developed by genexine and we own the greater china rights of this product which has the potential to address an important clinical table of contents need and to cover a significant market gap in pediatric growth hormone deficiency according to the frost amp sullivan report there are approximately 3 4 million pediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency in 2018 in greater china but only 3 7 of them receive growth hormone therapies which are mostly daily regimens in a previous phase 2 trial conducted by genexine in south korea and the eu both weekly and bi weekly administration of tj101 demonstrated similar therapeutic effects to daily injection of genotropin a short acting rhgh we are working towards submitting an ind application in 2020 for a phase 3 registrational trial in china highlights of our fast to poc global portfolio our fast to poc global strategy is demonstrated by our global portfolio which mainly consists of our internally developed novel or differentiated biologics our global portfolio focuses on two molecular classes 150 150 monoclonal antibodies and bi specific antibodies while we have been diligently pursuing our fast to poc global strategy we are aware that there is no assurance that we will always be successful in achieving poc or pivotal development milestones for any of our product candidates in our global portfolio in an accelerated manner see 147 risk factors 148 for a detailed description of the risks related to the development and commercialization of our drug candidates monoclonal antibodies 151 among the five monoclonal antibody drug candidates tjm2 tjc4 and tjd5 are undergoing phase 1 clinical trials in the united states having obtained ind approvals from the nmpa for tjc4 tjd5 and tjm2 we have initiated a phase 1 trial for tjc4 and expect to initiate phase 1 trials for tjd5 and tjm2 in china in early 2020 in addition we are collaborating with shanghai junshi biosciences co ltd or junshi to conduct clinical trials of the combination therapy of tjd5 and junshi 146 s pd 1 monoclonal antibody toripalimab in cancer patients with various types of solid tumors we have not initiated any research and development activities under such collaboration arrangement as of the date of this prospectus tj210 and tjx7 are at the cmc stage and are expected to be ready for ind submissions in 2020 for phase 1 clinical trials in the united states tjc4 is an internally discovered fully human monoclonal antibody targeting cd47 which is one of the most promising immuno oncology targets after pd 1 pd l1 blocking cd47 activates tumor engulfing macrophages a component of the innate immune system as an important cancer fighting mechanism cd47 antibodies are being actively pursued in clinical trials by a few global companies however current development efforts on cd47 antibody drugs are hampered by hematologic side effects such as anemia due to binding to human rbcs for example at least two clinical trials conducted by other companies have been suspended unlike competitor investigational drugs tjc4 is a rare antibody originally selected by design to purposefully avoid or minimize binding to rbcs while maintaining a high antibody affinity and tumor killing properties tjc4 146 s unique property of minimal rbc binding and no significant hematologic changes has been extensively validated in a whole series of robust in vitro assays and primate studies in a glp toxicology study involving 40 monkeys no hematologic side effects were seen even with repeated injections of 100 mg kg doses this unique property may enable tjc4 to be used safely in a broader patient population to explore its treatment potential in cancers differentiating it from other clinical stage cd47 investigational antibody drugs tjc4 is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial with cancer patients in the united states in parallel leveraging the phase 1 data generated in the united states we plan to begin a phase 1 clinical trial of tjc4 in patients with hematologic malignancies such as aml mds by early 2020 in china in addition we are collaborating with merck sharp amp dohme corp or msd in a phase 1 clinical trial in the united states for the combination therapy of tjc4 and msd 146 s pd 1 inhibitor keytruda pembrolizumab in cancer patients with several types of solid tumors we have not initiated any research and development activities under such collaboration arrangement as of the date of this prospectus bi specific antibody panel 151 this novel antibody class represents an emerging and fast moving area of new drug discovery bi specific antibodies are typically constructed to have a dual specificity of two selected antibodies or combined properties of an antibody linked with a cytokine previously called an immuno cytokine according to the frost amp sullivan report checkpoint inhibitors targeting pd 1 pd l1 had global sales of us 16 3 billion in 2018 and are predicted to reach us 63 4 billion in global sales by 2030 however despite the recent table of contents success of checkpoint inhibitors clinical efficacy of these drugs has been unsatisfactory it is estimated that over 60 of cancer patients including those with melanoma renal cell cancer colorectal cancer non small cell lung cancer urothelial cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma do not respond to pd 1 pd l1 monotherapies in addition some patients develop resistance after initial treatment with these therapies as a result the standard of care today leaves many cancer patients underserved there is consensus among cancer immunologists that tumors that do not respond to pd 1 pd l1 treatment have poor immunologic features such as an absence or paucity of tumor fighting immune cells or the presence of dysfunctional immune cells within the tumors collectively known as 147 cold tumors 148 we believe that pd 1 pd l1 non responders can be better treated with novel bi specific antibodies the unique and superior properties of these bi specific antibodies over pd l1 inhibitors alone stem from a second targeting component attached to the pd l1 antibody moiety of the bi specific molecules thereby enabling them to elicit a sufficient immune response and converting a 147 cold tumor 148 to an immune active 147 hot tumor 148 such unique properties of bi specific antibodies cannot be substituted by a combination of the pd l1 antibody with a selected second component either cytokine or antibody in a free form the underlying mechanism is such that the second component must be structurally integrated with the tumor engaging pd l1 antibody in order to concentrate and function inside the tumor which cannot be readily achieved by the two free agents used in combination we have successfully generated a panel of four bi specific antibodies in which our proprietary pd l1 antibody acts as the backbone the first signal and is linked with various second components the second signal including a 4 1bb agonist antibody tj l14b a b7 h3 antibody tj l1h3 a cd47 antibody tj l1c4 and an il 7 cytokine tj l1i7 which are shown to work synergistically with the pd l1 backbone in various assays and cancer animal models this unique panel of bi specific antibodies is only made possible by our proprietary and partnered antibody engineering technologies and the availability of our proprietary monoclonal antibodies furthermore we have generated two other bi specific antibodies tj c4gm and tj cldn4b that are tailor made to function as novel fortified antibodies by linking tjc4 with an engineered gm csf cytokine for the treatment of solid tumors and by linking our claudin 18 2 antibody with a 4 1bb antibody as a unique gastric cancer treatment agent that only activates t cells conditionally upon tumor engagement all bi specific antibodies have been validated in a series of robust in vitro and in vivo studies for biology proof of concept providing a solid basis for clinical validation in cancer patients our strategies we plan to achieve our goal by pursuing the following rapidly advance our china portfolio towards commercialization expand our research and development capabilities and footprint in the united states to advance our global portfolio build our manufacturing capabilities maximize the value of our pipeline our challenges investing in our adss involves risks if any of these risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our adss would likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the following is a summary of some of the principal risks that we face we have a limited operating history which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future we recorded net cash outflow from operating activities since our inception we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and if we are unable to obtain such financing we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our major drug candidates table of contents we depend substantially on the success of our investigational drugs and drug candidates all of which are in clinical or pre clinical development respectively and our ability to identify additional investigational drugs and drug candidates if we are unable to successfully identify new investigational drugs or drug candidates complete clinical development obtain regulatory approval and commercialize them or experience significant delays in doing so our business will be materially harmed we may not be able to identify discover or in license new drug candidates and may allocate our limited resources to pursue a particular drug candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on drug candidates or indications that may later prove to be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success even if we receive regulatory approval for our drug candidates we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review which may result in significant additional expenses and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates our drug candidates may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians patients third party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success as we rely on third parties to conduct our pre clinical studies and clinical trials if we lose our relationships with these third parties or if they do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our drug candidates and our business could be substantially harmed if we are unable to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our drug candidates or if the scope of such intellectual property rights obtained is not sufficiently broad third parties could develop and commercialize products and technologies similar or identical to ours and compete directly against us and our ability to successfully commercialize any product or technology may be adversely affected changes in the political and economic policies of the prc government may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to sustain our growth and expansion strategies please see 147 risk factors 148 147 special note regarding forward looking statements 148 and other information included in this prospectus for a discussion of these

should carefully consider all of the information in this prospectus including the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment in our adss any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in any such case the market price of our adss could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to our financial position and need for additional capital we have a limited operating history which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history our operations to date have focused on organizing and staffing our operations business planning raising capital establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting pre clinical and clinical trials of our drug candidates we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully manufacture obtain marketing approvals for or commercialize our drug candidates we have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales consequently any predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history we are focused on the discovery and development of innovative drugs for the treatment of various immuno oncological and immuno inflammatory diseases our limited operating history particularly in light of the rapidly evolving drug research and development industry in which we operate and the changing regulatory and market environments we encounter may make it difficult to evaluate our prospects for future performance as a result any assessment of our future performance or viability is subject to significant uncertainty we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early stage companies in rapidly evolving fields as we seek to transition to a company capable of supporting commercial activities if we do not address these risks and difficulties successfully our business will suffer we have incurred net losses in each period since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability investment in the development of biopharmaceutical products is highly speculative as it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risks that a drug candidate may fail to demonstrate efficacy and or safety to gain regulatory or marketing approvals or become commercially viable to date we have financed our activities primarily through private placements while we have generated revenue from licensing and collaboration deals we have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales to date and we continue to incur significant research and development expenses and other expenses related to our ongoing operations as a result we are not profitable and have incurred net losses in each period since our inception in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 our net losses were rmb298 2 million rmb402 8 million us 56 4 million and rmb1 103 4 million us 154 4 million respectively substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations we expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future and that these net losses will increase as we carry out certain activities relating to our development including but not limited to the following conducting clinical trials of our drug candidates manufacturing clinical trial materials through contract manufacturing organizations or cmos in and out of china seeking regulatory approvals for our drug candidates commercializing our drug candidates for which we have obtained marketing approval completing the construction of and maintaining our manufacturing facilities hiring additional clinical operational financial quality control and scientific personnel table of contents establishing a sales marketing and commercialization team for any future products that have obtained regulatory approval seeking to identify additional drug candidates obtaining maintaining expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio enforcing and defending any intellectual property related claims and acquiring or in licensing other drug candidates intellectual property and technologies typically it takes many years to develop one new drug from the time it is discovered to when it becomes available for treating patients during the process we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business the size of our future net losses will depend partially on the rate of the future growth of our expenses our ability to generate revenues and the timing and amount of milestone payments and other payments that we receive from or pay to third parties if any of our drug candidates fails during clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval or even if approved fails to achieve market acceptance our business may not become profitable even if we achieve profitability in the future we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods thereafter our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital and shareholders 146 equity we recorded net cash outflow from operating activities since our inception even if we consummate this offering we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations if we are unable to obtain such financing we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our major drug candidates since our inception our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash we had raised over us 400 million in pre ipo financing in the past three years we spent rmb252 2 million rmb280 7 million us 39 3 million and rmb652 0 million us 91 2 million in net cash to finance our operations in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 respectively we expect our expenses to increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities particularly as we advance the clinical development of our clinical stage drug candidates continue the research and development of our pre clinical stage drug candidates and initiate additional clinical trials of and seek regulatory approval for these and other future drug candidates in addition if we obtain regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses relating to product manufacturing marketing sales and distribution and post approval commitments to continue monitoring the efficacy and safety data of our future products on the market in particular costs that may be required for the manufacture of any drug candidate that has received regulatory approval may be substantial as we may need to modify or increase our production capacity in the future at manufacturing facilities we may also incur expenses as we create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company accordingly we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations through public or private equity offerings debt financing collaborations or licensing arrangements or other sources if we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms we could be forced to delay limit reduce or terminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts raising additional capital may cause dilution to the interests to the holders of our adss and our shareholders restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates we may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings debt financings collaborations licensing arrangements strategic alliances or partnerships and government grants or subsidies to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a holder of our adss the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could give rise to increased fixed payment obligations and also result in certain additional restrictive covenants such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business in addition the issuance of additional equity securities or the possibility of such issuance may cause the market price of our adss to decline in the event we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements in order to raise capital we may be required to accept unfavorable terms including relinquishing or licensing to a third party our rights to technologies or drug table of contents candidates on unfavorable terms which we would have otherwise sought to develop or commercialize on our own or reserve for future potential arrangements when we are more likely to achieve more favorable terms risks related to clinical development of our drug candidates clinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain while our exclusive focus is to develop drug candidates with potential to become novel or highly differentiated drugs in china and globally we cannot guarantee that we are able to achieve this for any of our drug candidates failure can occur at any time during the clinical development process the results of pre clinical studies and early clinical trials of our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results of later stage clinical trials drug candidates during later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired results in safety and efficacy despite having progressed through pre clinical studies and initial clinical trials and despite the level of scientific rigor in the study design and adequacy of execution in some instances there can be significant variability in safety and or efficacy results among different trials of the same drug candidate due to numerous factors including but not limited to differences in individual patient conditions including genetic differences and other compounding factors such as other medications or pre existing medical conditions in the case of any trials we conduct results may differ from earlier trials due to the larger number of clinical trial sites and additional countries and languages involved in such trials a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials we cannot guarantee that our future clinical trial results will be favorable based on currently available clinical and pre clinical data we depend substantially on the success of our drug candidates all of which are in pre clinical or clinical development and our ability to identify additional drug candidates if we are unable to successfully identify new drug candidates complete clinical development obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our drug candidates or experience significant delays in doing so our business will be materially harmed our business will depend on the successful development regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug candidates for the treatment of patients with our targeted indications all of which are still in pre clinical or clinical development and other new drug candidates that we may identify and develop as of the date of this prospectus we have obtained ind approvals from the nmpa for six of our drug candidates tj202 tj301 tj107 tjc4 tjd5 and tjm2 in addition we have obtained ind approvals from the fda for three of our drug candidates tjc4 tjd5 and tjm2 from the taiwan food and drug administration the 147 tfda 148 for two of our drug candidates tj202 and tj301 and from the korea ministry of food and drug safety the 147 mfds 148 for tj301 however we cannot guarantee that we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our other existing drug candidates in a timely manner or at all in addition none of our drug candidates has been approved for marketing in china or any other jurisdiction each of our drug candidates will require additional pre clinical and or clinical development regulatory approvals in multiple jurisdictions development of manufacturing supply and capacity substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenue from product sales the success of our drug candidates will depend on several factors including but not limited to the successful completion of pre clinical and or clinical trials or studies receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for planned clinical trials future clinical trials or drug registrations establishing adequate manufacturing capabilities and capacities commercialization of our existing drug candidates hiring sufficient technical experts to oversee all development and regulatory activities and license renewal and meeting of the safety requirements if we do not achieve one or more of these in a timely manner or at all we could experience significant delays in our ability to obtain approval for our drug candidates which would materially harm our business and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations as a result our financial condition results of operations and prospects will be materially and adversely harmed table of contents we may not be able to identify discover or in license new drug candidates and may allocate our limited resources to pursue a particular drug candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on drug candidates or indications that may later prove to be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success although a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued clinical testing potential approval and commercialization of our existing drug candidates the success of our business depends in part upon our ability to identify license discover develop or commercialize additional drug candidates research programs to identify new drug candidates require substantial technical financial and human resources we may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or drug candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to identify discover or in license new drug candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons including without limitation the following our research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential drug candidates our potential drug candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval and it may take greater human and financial resources to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for our drug candidates or to develop suitable potential drug candidates through internal research programs than we possess thereby limiting our ability to diversify and expand our drug portfolio because we have limited financial and managerial resources we focus on research programs and drug candidates for specific indications as a result we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other drug candidates or for other indications that later may prove to have greater commercial potential or a greater likelihood of success our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities accordingly there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for our drug candidates or to develop suitable potential drug candidates through internal research programs which could materially adversely affect our future growth and prospects if we encounter delays or difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials our clinical development progress could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected we may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our drug candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the nmpa the fda or similar regulatory authorities or if there are delays in the enrollment of eligible patients as a result of the competitive clinical enrollment environment the inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who meet the applicable criteria for our clinical trials would result in significant delays as of the date of this prospectus we have initiated clinical trials for tj301 in south korea and greater china for tj107 in china for tj202 in greater china for tjc4 in china and the united states and for tjm2 and tjd5 in the united states in addition we expect to initiate clinical trials for tjm2 and tjd5 by early 2020 in china in addition some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for drug candidates that treat the same indications as our drug candidates and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in the clinical trials of our competitors 146 drug candidates which may further delay our clinical trial enrollments patient enrollment for our clinical trials may be affected by other factors including but not limited to the following severity of the disease under investigation total size and nature of the relevant patient population design and eligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question perceived risks and benefits of the drug candidate under study our resources to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials patient referral practices of physicians availability of competing therapies also undergoing clinical trials table of contents our investigators 146 or clinical trial sites 146 efforts to screen and recruit eligible patients and proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our drug candidates if clinical trials of our drug candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing or ultimately be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our drug candidates we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in humans we may experience numerous unexpected events during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our drug candidates including without limitation regulators institutional review boards or irbs or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site our inability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective cros and trial sites the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different cros and trial sites manufacturing issues including problems with manufacturing supply quality compliance with good manufacturing practice or gmp or obtaining sufficient quantities of a drug candidate from third parties for use in a clinical trial clinical trials of our drug candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results and we may decide to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon drug development programs or regulators may require us to do so the number of patients required for clinical trials of our drug candidates may be larger than we anticipate enrollment may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate or patients may drop out at a higher rate than we anticipate our third party contractors including clinical investigators may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all we might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our drug candidates for various reasons including a finding of a lack of clinical response or other unexpected characteristics or a finding that participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks regulators irbs or ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research or not rely on the results of clinical research for various reasons including non compliance with regulatory requirements the cost of clinical trials of our drug candidates may be greater than we anticipate and the supply or quality of our drug candidates companion diagnostics or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates may be insufficient or inadequate if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our drug candidates beyond those that we currently plan if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our drug candidates or other testing if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if they raise safety concerns we may i be delayed in obtaining regulatory approval for our drug candidates ii obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended iii not obtain regulatory approval at all iv have the drug removed from the market after obtaining regulatory approval v be subject to additional post marketing testing requirements vi be subject to restrictions on how the drug is distributed or used or vii be unable to obtain reimbursement for use of the drug significant clinical trial delays may also increase our development costs and could shorten any periods during which we have the exclusive right to commercialize our drug candidates or allow our competitors to bring drugs to market before we do this could impair our ability to commercialize our drug candidates and may harm our business and results of operations table of contents risks related to obtaining regulatory approval for our drug candidates all material aspects of the research development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products are heavily regulated all jurisdictions in which we intend to conduct our pharmaceutical industry activities regulate these activities in great depth and detail we intend to focus our activities in the major markets of china and the united states these jurisdictions strictly regulate the pharmaceutical industry and in doing so they employ broadly similar regulatory strategies including regulation of product development and approval manufacturing and marketing sales and distribution of products however there are differences in the regulatory regimes that make for a more complex and costly regulatory compliance burden for a company like us that plans to operate in these regions the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate laws and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process and approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions these sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications withdrawal of an approval license revocation clinical hold voluntary or mandatory product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts providing restitution undergoing disgorgement or other civil or criminal penalties failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business the regulatory approval processes of the nmpa the fda and other comparable regulatory authorities are time consuming and may evolve over time and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates our business will be substantially harmed the time required to obtain the approval of the nmpa the fda and other comparable regulatory authorities is inherently uncertain and depends on numerous factors including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities generally such approvals take many years to obtain following the commencement of pre clinical studies and clinical trials although they are typically provided within 12 to 18 months after clinical trials are completed in addition approval policies regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a drug candidate 146 s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions as of the date of this prospectus we have obtained ind approvals from the nmpa for tj202 tj301 tj107 tjc4 tjd5 and tjm2 in addition we have obtained ind approvals from the fda for tjc4 tjd5 and tjm2 from the tfda for tj202 and tj301 and from the mfds for tj301 however we cannot guarantee that we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our other existing drug candidates or any drug candidates we may discover in license or acquire and seek to develop in the future our drug candidates could fail to receive the regulatory approval of the nmpa the fda or a comparable regulatory authority for many reasons including without disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials failure to demonstrate that a drug candidate is safe and effective and potent for its proposed indication failure of our clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval failure of our clinical trial process to pass relevant good clinical practice 147 gcp 148 inspections failure to demonstrate that a drug candidate 146 s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks disagreement with our interpretation of data from pre clinical studies or clinical insufficient data collected from the clinical trials of our drug candidates to support the submission and filing of a new drug application or nda or other submissions or to obtain regulatory approval failure of our drug candidates to pass current good manufacturing practice 147 cgmp 148 inspections during the regulatory review process or across the production cycle of our drug failure of our clinical sites to pass audits carried out by the nmpa the fda or comparable regulatory authorities resulting in a potential invalidation of our research data findings by the nmpa the fda or comparable regulatory authorities of deficiencies related to our manufacturing processes or the facilities of third party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies table of contents changes in approval policies or regulations that render our pre clinical and clinical data insufficient for approval and failure of our clinical trial process to keep up with any scientific or technological advancements required by approval policies or regulations the nmpa the fda or a comparable regulatory authority may require more information including additional pre clinical or clinical data to support approval which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans even if we were to obtain approval regulatory authorities may approve any of our drug candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post marketing clinical trials or approve a drug candidate with an indication that is not desirable for the successful commercialization of that drug candidate any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects of our drug candidates the absence of patent linkage patent term extension and data and market exclusivity for nmpa approved pharmaceutical products could increase the risk of early generic competition with our products in china in the united states the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended by the law generally referred to as 147 hatch waxman 148 provides the opportunity for patent term restoration meaning a patent term extension of up to five years to reflect patent term lost during certain portions of product development and the fda regulatory review process hatch waxman also has a process for patent linkage pursuant to which the fda will stay approval of certain follow on applications during the pendency of litigation between the follow on applicant and the patent holder or licensee generally for a period of 30 months finally hatch waxman provides for statutory exclusivities that can prevent submission or approval of certain follow on marketing applications for example federal law provides a five year period of exclusivity within the united states to the first applicant to obtain approval of a new chemical entity and three years of exclusivity protecting certain innovations to previously approved active ingredients where the applicant was required to conduct new clinical investigations to obtain approval for the modification similarly the united states orphan drug act provides seven years of market exclusivity for certain drugs to treat rare diseases where the fda designates the drug candidate as an orphan drug and the drug is approved for the designated orphan indication these provisions designed to promote innovation can prevent competing products from entering the market for a certain period of time after the fda grants marketing approval for the innovative product depending upon the timing duration and specifics of any fda marketing approval process for any drug candidates we may develop one or more of our u s patents if issued may be eligible for limited patent term extension under hatch waxman hatch waxman permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during clinical trials and the fda regulatory review process a patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of drug approval only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended however we may not be granted an extension because of for example failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process failing to apply within applicable deadlines failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements furthermore the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request in china however there is no currently effective law or regulation providing for patent term extension patent linkage or data exclusivity referred to as regulatory data protection therefore a lower cost generic drug can emerge onto the market much more quickly chinese regulators have set forth a framework for integrating patent linkage and data exclusivity into the chinese regulatory regime as well as for establishing a pilot program for patent term extension to be implemented this framework will require adoption of regulations to date no regulations have been issued these factors result in weaker protection for us against generic competition in china than could be available to us in the united states for instance the patents we have in china are not yet eligible to be extended for patent term lost during clinical trials and the regulatory review process if we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed table of contents our drug candidates may cause undesirable adverse events or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following regulatory approval undesirable adverse events caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt delay or halt clinical trials and may result in a more restrictive label a delay or denial of regulatory approval by the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities or a significant change in our clinical protocol or even our development plan in particular as is the case with drugs treating cancers and auto immune diseases it is likely that there may be side effects such as nausea fatigue and infusion related reactions associated with the use of certain of our drug candidates results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity or prevalence of certain adverse events in such an event our trials could be suspended or terminated and the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our drug candidates for any or all targeted indications adverse events related to our drug candidates may affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial and could result in potential liability claims any of these occurrences may significantly harm our reputation business financial condition and prospects additionally if we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by those of our existing drug candidates that have received regulatory approval or our other drug candidates after having received regulatory approval this may lead to potentially significant negative consequences which include but are not limited to the following we may suspend marketing of the drug candidate regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of or revoke the licenses for the drug candidate regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label the fda may require the establishment of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or rems or the nmpa or a comparable regulatory authority may require the establishment of a similar strategy that may for instance restrict distribution of our drugs and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us we may be required to conduct specific post marketing studies we could be subjected to litigation proceedings and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients and our reputation may suffer any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any particular drug candidate that is approved and could significantly harm our business results of operations and prospects further combination therapy such as using our wholly owned drug candidates as well as third party agents may involve unique adverse events that could be exacerbated compared with adverse events from monotherapies results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity or prevalence of adverse events these types of adverse events could be caused by our drug candidates and could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt delay or halt clinical trials and may result in a more restrictive indication or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authority if we are unable to obtain the nmpa approval for our drug candidates to be eligible for an expedited registration pathway as innovative drug candidates the time and cost we incur to obtain regulatory approvals may increase the nmpa has mechanisms in place for expedited review and approval for drug candidates that are innovative drug applications provided such drug or drug candidate has a new and clearly defined structure pharmacological property and apparent clinical value and has not been marketed anywhere in the world however there is no assurance that an innovative drug designation will be granted by the nmpa for any of our drug candidates moreover an innovative drug designation which is typically granted only towards the end of a drug 146 s developmental stage does not increase the likelihood that our drug candidates will receive regulatory approval on a fast track basis or at all further there have been recent regulatory initiatives in china in relation to clinical trial approvals the evaluation and approval of certain drugs and medical devices and the simplification and acceleration of the clinical trial process as a result the regulatory process in china is evolving and subject to change any future policies or changes to current polices might require us to change our planned clinical study design or otherwise spend additional resources table of contents and effort to obtain approval of our drug candidates in addition policy changes may contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for certain age groups warnings precautions or contraindications or may be subject to burdensome post approval study or risk management requirements if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates in the prc or any approval contains significant limitations we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of our drug candidates or any other drug candidate that we may in license acquire or develop in the future even if we receive regulatory approval for our drug candidates we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review which may result in significant additional expenses and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates if the nmpa the fda or a comparable regulatory authority approves any of our drug candidates the manufacturing processes labeling packaging distribution adverse event reporting storage advertising promotion and recordkeeping for the drug will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements on pharmacovigilance these requirements include submissions of safety and other post marketing information and reports registration random quality control testing adherence to any chemistry manufacturing and controls 147 cmc 148 variations continued compliance with current cgmps and gcps and potential post approval studies for the purposes of license renewal any regulatory approvals that we receive for our drug candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or contain requirements for potentially costly post marketing studies including phase 4 studies for the surveillance and monitoring of the safety and efficacy of the drug in addition once a drug is approved by the nmpa the fda or a comparable regulatory authority for marketing it is possible that there could be a subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drug including problems with third party manufacturers or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements if any of the foregoing occurs with respect to our drug products it may result in among other things restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug withdrawal of the drug from the market or voluntary or mandatory drug recalls fines warning letters or holds on our clinical trials refusal by the nmpa the fda or comparable regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of drug license approvals refusal by the nmpa the fda or comparable regulatory authorities to accept any of our other ind approvals ndas or blas drug seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs and injunctions or the imposition of civil administrative or criminal penalties any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources and could generate negative publicity moreover regulatory policies may change or additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance we may lose the regulatory approvals that we have already obtained and may not achieve or sustain profitability which in turn could significantly harm our business financial condition and prospects illegal and or parallel imports and counterfeit pharmaceutical products may reduce demand for our future approved drug candidates and could have a negative impact on our reputation and business the illegal importation of competing products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the demand for our future approved drug candidates and in turn may adversely affect our sales and profitability in china and other countries where we commercialize our products unapproved foreign imports of prescription drugs are illegal under the current laws of china however illegal imports may continue to occur or even increase as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain these lower priced imports continues to grow furthermore cross border imports from lower priced markets which are known as parallel imports into higher priced markets could harm sales of our future drug products and exert table of contents commercial pressure on pricing within one or more markets in addition competent government authorities may expand consumers 146 ability to import lower priced versions of our future approved products or competing products from outside china or other countries where we operate any future legislation or regulations that increase consumer access to lower priced medicines from outside china or other countries where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business certain products distributed or sold in the pharmaceutical market may be manufactured without proper licenses or approvals or be fraudulently mislabeled with respect to their content or manufacturers these products are generally referred to as counterfeit pharmaceutical products the counterfeit pharmaceutical product control and enforcement system particularly in developing markets such as china may be inadequate to discourage or eliminate the manufacturing and sale of counterfeit pharmaceutical products imitating our products since counterfeit pharmaceutical products in many cases have very similar appearances compared with the authentic pharmaceutical products but are generally sold at lower prices counterfeits of our products could quickly erode the demand for our future approved drug candidates in addition counterfeit pharmaceutical products are not expected to meet our or our collaborators 146 rigorous manufacturing and testing standards a patient who receives a counterfeit pharmaceutical product may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit pharmaceutical products sold under our or our collaborators 146 brand name s in addition thefts of inventory at warehouses plants or while in transit which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety our reputation and our business risks related to commercialization of our drug candidates our drug candidates may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians patients third party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success even if our drug candidates receive regulatory approval they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians and patients and others in the medical community physicians and patients may prefer other drugs or drug candidates to ours if our drug candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance we may not generate significant revenue from sales of our drugs or drug candidates and may not become profitable the degree of market acceptance of our drug candidates if and only when they are approved for commercial sale will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the clinical indications for which our drug candidates are approved physicians hospitals and patients considering our drug candidates as a safe and effective treatment whether our drug candidates have achieved the perceived advantages of our drug candidates over alternative treatments the prevalence and severity of any side effects product labeling or package insert requirements of the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved by the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory timing of market introduction of our drug candidates as well as competitive drugs cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement under the national and provincial reimbursement drug lists in the prc or from third party payors and government authorities in the united states or any other jurisdictions willingness of patients to pay any out of pocket expenses in the absence of coverage and reimbursement by third party payors and government authorities relative convenience and ease of administration including as compared with alternative treatments and competitive the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts table of contents if our drug candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians patients hospitals or others in the medical community we will not be able to generate significant revenue or become profitable even if our drugs achieve market acceptance we may not be able to maintain such market acceptance over time if new products or technologies are introduced which are more favorably received than our drugs are more cost effective or render our drugs obsolete we face intense competition and rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may develop therapies that are similar more advanced or more effective than ours which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change while our exclusive focus is to develop drug candidates with potential to become novel or highly differentiated drugs we continue to face competition with respect to our current drug candidates and will face competition with respect to any drug candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future our competitors include major pharmaceutical companies specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide we are developing our drug candidates for the treatment of cancer in competition with a number of large biopharmaceutical companies that currently market and sell drugs or are pursuing the development of drugs also for the treatment of cancer some of these competitive drugs and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach and others are based on entirely different approaches for details see 147 business 151 our drug pipeline 148 potential competitors further include academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research development manufacturing and commercialization many of our competitors have substantially greater financial technical and other resources such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors as a result these companies may obtain regulatory approval from the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well for example the nmpa has recently accelerated market approval of drugs for diseases with high unmet medical need in particular the nmpa may review and approve drugs that have gained regulatory market approval in the united states the european union or japan in the recent ten years without requiring further clinical trials in china this may lead to potential increased competition from drugs which have already obtained approval in other jurisdictions smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large established companies competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries our competitors may succeed in developing acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis products that are more effective or less costly than any drug candidate that we may develop or achieve earlier patent protection regulatory approval product commercialization and market penetration than we do additionally technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential drug candidates uneconomical or obsolete and we may not be successful in marketing our drug candidates against competitors the manufacture of biopharmaceutical products is a complex process which requires significant expertise and capital investment and if we encounter problems in establishing our manufacturing capabilities or manufacturing our future products our business could suffer we have limited experience in managing the manufacturing process the manufacture of biopharmaceutical products is a complex process in part due to strict regulatory requirements as of the date of this prospectus we have no existing manufacturing infrastructure or capabilities if we are unable to identify an appropriate production site or a suitable partner to develop our manufacturing infrastructure or fail to do so in a timely manner this may lead to significant delays in the manufacturing of our drug candidates once regulatory and marketing approvals have been obtained the investment for building a new biologics manufacturing facility that is compliant with cgmp regulations may also be a significant upfront cost for us in turn this could materially harm our commercialization plans table of contents in addition problems may arise during the manufacturing process for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or expansion of any future manufacturing facilities including changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of products produced increases in the prices of raw materials physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply man made or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of future products that batch of future products may have to be discarded and we may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relationships time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before such product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred we have no experience in launching and marketing drug candidates we may not be able to effectively build and manage our sales network or benefit from third party collaborators 146 sales network we currently have no sales marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience in marketing drugs we intend to develop an in house marketing organization and sales force which will require significant capital expenditures management resources and time we will have to compete with other biopharmaceutical companies to recruit hire train and retain marketing and sales personnel if we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales marketing and commercial distribution capabilities for any or all of the drugs we develop we will likely pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our drugs however there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements or if we are able to do so that they will have effective sales forces any revenue we receive will depend on the efforts of such third parties which may not be successful we may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our drug candidates ourselves we will also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our drug candidates there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in house sales and commercial distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third party collaborators to successfully commercialize any product and as a result we may not be able to generate product sales revenue even if we are able to commercialize any approved drug candidates reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our drug candidates and we may be subject to unfavorable pricing regulations which could harm our business the regulations that govern regulatory approvals pricing and reimbursement for new therapeutic products vary widely from country to country some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed in many countries the pricing review period begins after marketing or licensing approval is granted in some non u s markets prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted as a result we might obtain regulatory approval for a drug in a particular country but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the drug and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the drug in that country adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more drug candidates even if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval for example according to a statement opinions on reforming the review and approval process for pharmaceutical products and medical devices issued by the prc state council in august 2015 the enterprises applying for new drug approval will be required to undertake that the selling price of new drug on prc mainland market shall not be higher than the comparable market prices of the product in its country of origin or prc 146 s neighboring markets as applicable our ability to commercialize any drugs successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these drugs and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations government authorities and third party payors such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels a primary trend in the global healthcare industry is cost containment government authorities and these third party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement table of contents for particular medications increasingly third party payors are requiring that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products we cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any drug that we commercialize and if reimbursement is available what the level of reimbursement will be reimbursement may impact the demand for or the price of any drug for which we obtain regulatory approval obtaining reimbursement for our drugs may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels we may not be able to successfully commercialize any drug candidate that we successfully develop there may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for approved drug candidates and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug candidates are approved by the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities moreover eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs including research development manufacture sale and distribution interim payments for new drugs if applicable may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent payment rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used may be based on payments allowed for lower cost drugs that are already reimbursed and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future weakening of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the united states our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government funded and private payors for any future approved drug candidates and any new drugs that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our business our operating results and our overall financial condition current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our drug candidates and affect the prices we may obtain in the united states and certain other jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates restrict post approval activities and affect our ability to sell profitably any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 or collectively the aca became law the aca is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending enhance remedies against fraud and abuse add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms among the provisions of the aca of importance to our drug candidates are the following an annual nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the medicaid drug rebate program expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act and the anti kickback statute new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance a new medicare part d coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50 point of sale discounts off negotiated prices extension of manufacturers 146 medicaid rebate liability expansion of eligibility criteria for medicaid programs expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the public health service act 146 s pharmaceutical pricing new requirements to report to cms financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals a new requirement to annually report to the fda drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians a new patient centered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research table of contents legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products we cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted or whether the fda regulations guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals if any of our drug candidates may be in addition increased scrutiny by the u s congress of the fda 146 s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post marketing conditions and other requirements as we out license some of our commercialization rights and engage in other forms of collaboration worldwide including conducting clinical trials abroad we may be exposed to specific risks of conducting our business and operations in international markets markets outside of china form an important component of our growth strategy as we out license some of our commercialization rights to third parties outside the prc and conduct certain of our clinical trials abroad if we fail to obtain applicable licenses or fail to enter into strategic collaboration arrangements with third parties in these markets or if these collaboration arrangements turn out unsuccessful our revenue generating growth potential will be adversely affected moreover international business relationships subject us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations including efforts to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties in connection with our international sales marketing and distribution efforts may increase our expenses or divert our management 146 s attention from the acquisition or development of drug candidates changes in a specific country 146 s or region 146 s political and cultural climate or economic condition differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and marketing internationally difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights potential third party patent rights unexpected changes in tariffs trade barriers and regulatory requirements economic weakness including inflation or political instability compliance with tax employment immigration and labor laws for employees traveling abroad the effects of applicable non prc tax structures and potentially adverse tax currency fluctuations which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue and other obligations incidental to doing business in another country workforce uncertainty and labor unrest the potential for so called parallel importing which is what happens when a local seller faced with high or higher local prices opts to import goods from an international market with low or lower prices rather than buying them locally failure of our employees and contracted third parties to comply with office of foreign assets control rules and regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act of the united states and other applicable rules and regulations production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad and business interruptions resulting from geo political actions including war and terrorism or natural disasters including earthquakes volcanoes typhoons floods hurricanes and fires these and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain revenue from international markets table of contents if safety efficacy or other issues arise with any medical product that is used in combination with our drug candidates we may be unable to market such drug candidate or may experience significant regulatory delays or supply shortages and our business could be materially harmed we plan to develop certain of our drug candidates for use as a combination therapy if the nmpa the fda or another comparable regulatory agency revokes its approval of another therapeutic we use in combination with our drug candidates we will not be able to market our drug candidates in combination with such revoked therapeutic if safety or efficacy issues arise with these or other therapeutics that we seek to combine with our drug candidates in the future we may experience significant regulatory delays and we may be required to redesign or terminate the applicable clinical trials in addition if manufacturing or other issues result in a supply shortage of any component of our combination drug candidates or if we cannot secure supply of any component of our drug candidates at commercially reasonable or acceptable prices we may not be able to complete clinical development of our drug candidates on our current timeline or within our current budget or at all lack of third party combination drugs may materially and adversely affect demand for our drugs our drug candidates may be administered in combination with drugs of other pharmaceutical companies as one regimen in addition we often use such third party drugs in our development and clinical trials as controls for our studies as a result both the results of our clinical trials and the sales of our drugs may be affected by the availability of these third party drugs if other pharmaceutical companies discontinue these combination drugs regimens that use these combination drugs may no longer be prescribed and we may not be able to introduce or find an alternative drug to be used in combination with our drugs at all or in a timely manner and on a cost effective basis as a result demand for our drugs may be lowered which would in turn materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations risks related to our reliance on third parties as we rely on third parties to conduct our pre clinical studies and clinical trials if we lose our relationships with these third parties or if they do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our drug candidates and our business could be substantially harmed we have relied on and plan to continue to rely on third party contract research organization 147 cros 148 to monitor and manage data for some of our ongoing pre clinical and clinical programs we rely on these parties for the execution of our pre clinical and clinical trials and control only certain aspects of their activities nevertheless we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the cros does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities we also rely on third parties to assist in conducting our pre clinical studies in accordance with good laboratory practices 147 glp 148 we and our cros are required to comply with gcp glp and other regulatory regulations and guidelines enforced by the nmpa the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our drug candidates in clinical development regulatory authorities enforce these gcp glp or other regulatory requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors investigators and trial sites if we or any of our cros fail to comply with applicable gcp glp or other regulatory requirements the relevant data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical studies before approving our marketing applications there can be no assurance that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with gcp requirements in addition our clinical trials must be conducted with drug candidates or products produced under cgmp requirements failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat pre clinical and clinical trials which would delay the regulatory approval process our cros have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an unrectified material breach if any of our relationships with our third party cros is terminated we may not be able to i enter into arrangements with alternative cros or do so on commercially reasonable terms or ii meet our desired clinical development timelines in addition there is a natural transition period when a new cro commences work and the new cro may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider and data from our clinical trials may be compromised as a table of contents result there is also a need for relevant technology to be transferred to the new cro which may take time and further delay our development timelines except for remedies available to us under our agreements with our cros we cannot control whether or not our cros devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical nonclinical and pre clinical programs if our cros do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols regulatory requirements or for other reasons our clinical trials may be extended delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates as a result our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates would be harmed and our costs could increase in turn our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or compromised because we rely on third parties our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited outsourcing these functions involves certain risks that third parties may not perform to our standards may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all in addition the use of third party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these third parties which could increase the risk that such information will be misappropriated we currently have a small number of employees which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third party service providers to the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third party service providers in the future our business may be adversely affected though we carefully manage our relationships with our cros there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and prospects we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture at least a portion of our drug candidate supplies and we intend to rely on third parties for at least a portion of the manufacturing process of our drug candidates if approved our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices although we plan to either construct or acquire a facility that will be used as our clinical scale manufacturing and processing facility we intend to also partially rely on third party vendors to manufacture supplies and process our drug candidates we have not yet manufactured or processed our drug candidates on a commercial scale and may not be able to do so for any of our drug candidates we have limited experience in managing the manufacturing process and our process may be more difficult or expensive than the approaches currently in use our anticipated reliance on third party manufacturers exposes us to certain risks including but not limited to the following we may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities must approve any manufacturers as part of their regulatory oversight of our drug candidates this approval would require new testing and cgmp compliance inspections by the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities in addition a new manufacturer would have to be educated in or develop substantially equivalent processes for production of our drugs our contract manufacturers may have little or no experience with manufacturing our drug candidates and therefore may require a significant amount of support from us in order to implement and maintain the infrastructure and processes required to manufacture our drug candidates our contract manufacturers may have limited capacity or limited manufacturing slots which may affect the timeline for the production of our drugs our contract manufacturers might be unable to timely manufacture our drug candidates or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs if any contract manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures and other logistical support requirements our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed may not devote sufficient resources to our drugs or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce store and distribute our drugs table of contents our contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the nmpa and the fda to ensure strict compliance with cgmp and other government regulations in the prc and the united states respectively and by other comparable regulatory authorities for corresponding regulatory requirements we do not have control over third party manufacturers 146 compliance with these regulations and requirements we may not own or may have to share the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our drugs our contract manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreements with us our contract manufacturers may be unable to sustain their business and become bankrupt as a result raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier may not be available or may not be suitable or acceptable for use due to material or component defects products and components from our third party manufacturers may be subject to additional customs and import charges which may cause us to incur delays or additional costs as a result our contract manufacturers and critical reagent suppliers may be subject to inclement weather as well as natural or man made disasters and our contract manufacturers may have unacceptable or inconsistent product quality success rates and yields each of these risks could delay or prevent the completion of our clinical trials or the approval of any of our drug candidates by the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities result in higher costs or adversely impact the commercialization of our drug candidates in addition we will rely on third parties to perform certain specification tests on our drug candidates prior to delivery to patients if these tests are not appropriately done and test data is not reliable patients could be put at risk of serious harm and the nmpa the fda or other comparable regulatory authorities could place significant restrictions on our company until deficiencies are remedied the manufacture of biopharmaceutical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls currently our drug raw materials for our manufacturing activities are supplied by multiple source suppliers we have agreements for the supply of drug materials with manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands in addition we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist however there is a risk that if supplies are interrupted our business would be materially harmed manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production particularly in scaling up or out validating the production process and assuring high reliability of the manufacturing process including the absence of contamination these problems include logistics and shipping difficulties with production costs and yields quality control including stability of the product product testing operator error and availability of qualified personnel as well as compliance with strictly enforced regulations in the prc the united states and other applicable jurisdictions further if contaminants are discovered in the supply of our drug candidates or in the manufacturing facilities such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time for us to investigate and remedy the contamination there can be no assurance that any stability failures or other issues relating to the manufacture of our drug candidates will not occur in the future additionally our contract manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environment if our contract manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations our ability to provide our drug candidate to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of our clinical trials increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and depending upon the period of delay require us to begin new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely table of contents we have entered into collaborations and may form or seek collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements we may form or seek strategic alliances create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our drug candidates and any future drug candidates that we may develop any of these relationships may require us to incur recurring or non recurring expenses and other charges increase our near and long term expenditures issue securities that dilute the value of our adss or disrupt our management and business for example we have entered into a license and collaboration agreement with morphosys ag 147 morphosys 148 pursuant to which we in licensed from morphosys the development and commercialization rights of tj202 in greater china in addition we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex moreover we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our drug candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our drug candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy if and when we collaborate with a third party for the development and commercialization of a drug candidate we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that drug candidate to the third party further collaborations involving our drug candidates are subject to specific risks which include but are not limited to the following collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaborators may not pursue the development and commercialization of our drug candidates or may elect not to continue or renew the development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results change in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive drugs availability of funding or other external factors such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities collaborators may delay clinical trials provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial discontinue a clinical trial repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing collaborators could independently develop or develop with third parties drugs that compete directly or indirectly with our drug candidates or future drugs collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our drug candidates or future drugs may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability collaborators may not always be cooperative or responsive in providing their services in a clinical trial disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause a delay or termination of the research development or commercialization of our drug candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources collaborations may be terminated and if terminated may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable drug candidates and collaborators may own or co own intellectual property covering our drug candidates or future drugs that results from our collaborating with them and in such cases we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property as a result if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our drugs we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate these agreements or partnerships with our existing operations and company culture which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business neither can we be certain that following a strategic transaction or license we will be able to achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction if we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators table of contents on a timely basis on acceptable terms or at all we may have to curtail the development of a drug candidate reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense if we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all if we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities we may not be able to further develop our drug candidates or bring them to market and generate product sales revenue which would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our drug candidates or if the scope of such intellectual property rights obtained is not sufficiently broad third parties could develop and commercialize products and technologies similar or identical to ours and compete directly against us and our ability to successfully commercialize any product or technology may be adversely affected our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and drug candidates from competition by obtaining maintaining defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights including patent rights as of september 30 2019 our owned patent portfolio consist of five patents and 156 patent applications primarily in connection with the drug candidates in our global portfolio including 17 patent cooperation treaty 147 pct 148 patent applications 10 u s patent applications 13 prc patent applications and 116 patent applications in other jurisdictions in addition as of september 30 2019 we in licensed the greater china and korea rights relating to 20 issued patents and 24 pending patent applications primarily in connection with tj202 tj101 tj301 enoblituzumab and tj107 we seek to protect the drug candidates and technology that we consider commercially important by filing patent applications in china the united states and other countries or regions relying on trade secrets or pharmaceutical regulatory protection or employing a combination of these methods this process is expensive and time consuming and we or our licensors may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications in all jurisdictions at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner it is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation as a result the issuance scope validity enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or drug candidates or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and drug candidates the patent examination process may require us or our licensors to narrow the scope of the claims of our or our licensors 146 pending and future patent applications which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained we cannot assure that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found if such prior art exists it can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent application from being issued as a patent even if patents do issue on any of these applications there can be no assurance that a third party will not challenge their validity enforceability or scope which may result in the patent claims being narrowed or invalidated or that we will obtain sufficient claim scope in those patents to prevent a third party from competing successfully with our drug candidates we may become involved in interference inter partes review post grant review ex parte reexamination derivation opposition or similar other proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others an adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of or invalidate our patent rights allow third parties to commercialize our technology or drug candidates and compete directly with us or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drug candidates without infringing third party patent rights thus even if our patent applications issue as patents they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage table of contents our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or drug candidates in a non infringing manner the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope validity or enforceability and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the united states and other countries such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed invalidated or held unenforceable which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and drug candidates or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drug candidates given the amount of time required for the development testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates patents protecting such assets might expire before or shortly after such assets are commercialized as a result our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drug candidates similar or identical to ours changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection under the america invents act 147 aia 148 enacted in 2011 the united states moved to this first to file system in early 2013 from the previous system under which the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent assuming the other requirements for patentability are met the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries and patent applications in the united states and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all therefore we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions we enjoy only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world including in the prc filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending patents covering our drug candidates in all countries throughout the world could be prohibitively expensive competitors may use our and our licensors 146 technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own drug candidates and further may export otherwise infringing drug candidates to territories including the prc where we and our licensors have patent protection but enforcement rights are not as strong as that in the united states or europe these drug candidates may compete with our drug candidates and our and our licensors 146 patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing the laws of some jurisdictions including the prc do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws or rules and regulations in the united states and europe and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions the legal systems of certain countries particularly certain developing countries do not favor the enforcement of patents trade secrets and other intellectual property protection which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing drug candidates in violation of our proprietary rights generally proceedings to enforce our patent rights in other jurisdictions whether or not successful could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing as patents and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if any may not be commercially meaningful accordingly our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license furthermore while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our drug candidates accordingly our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets if we or our licensors encounter difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions the value of these rights may be diminished and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions some countries also have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties in addition some countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors in those countries the patent owner may have limited remedies which could materially table of contents diminish the value of such patents if we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business our competitive position may be impaired obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non compliance with these requirements periodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the united states patent and trademark office 147 uspto 148 and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of a patent in addition the uspto and other foreign patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural documentary fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process while an inadvertent failure to make payment of such fees or to comply with such provisions can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules there are situations in which such non compliance will result in the abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application and the partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction non compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits and non payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents within prescribed time limits if we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our drug candidates or if we or our licensors otherwise allow our patents or patent applications to be abandoned or lapse our competitors might be able to enter the market which would hurt our competitive position and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates in any indication for which they are approved our owned and in licensed patents and other intellectual property may be subject to further priority disputes or to inventorship disputes and similar proceedings if we or our licensors are unsuccessful in any of these proceedings we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to modify or cease the development manufacture and commercialization of one or more of the drug candidates we may develop which could have a material adverse impact on our business we or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in licensed patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co inventor if we or our licensors are unsuccessful in any interference proceedings or other priority or validity disputes including any patent oppositions to which we or they are subject we may lose valuable intellectual property rights through the loss of one or more patents owned or licensed or our owned or licensed patent claims may be narrowed invalidated or held unenforceable in addition if we or our licensors are unsuccessful in any inventorship disputes to which we or they are subject we may lose valuable intellectual property rights such as exclusive ownership of or the exclusive right to use our owned or in licensed patents if we or our licensors are unsuccessful in any interference proceeding or other priority or inventorship dispute we may be required to obtain and maintain licenses from third parties including parties involved in any such interference proceedings or other priority or inventorship disputes such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or may be non exclusive if we are unable to obtain and maintain such licenses we may need to modify or cease the development manufacture and commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates the loss of exclusivity or the narrowing of our owned and licensed patent claims could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical drug products any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects even if we are successful in an interference proceeding or other similar priority or inventorship disputes it could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and other employees claims that our drug candidates or the sale or use of our future products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties could result in costly litigation or could require substantial time and money to resolve even if litigation is avoided we cannot guarantee that our drug candidates or the sale or use of our future products do not and will not in the future infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate third party patents or other intellectual property rights third parties might allege that we are infringing their patent rights or that we have misappropriated their trade secrets or that we are otherwise violating their intellectual property rights whether with respect to the manner in which we have conducted our research or with respect to the use or manufacture of the compounds we have developed or are developing litigation relating to patents and other intellectual property rights in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries is common including patent infringement lawsuits the various markets in which we plan table of contents to operate are subject to frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights some claimants may have substantially greater resources than we have and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could third parties might resort to litigation against us or other parties we have agreed to indemnify which litigation could be based on either existing intellectual property or intellectual property that arises in the future for example we are aware of a third party u s patent and its counterpart european patents that relate to the use of antibodies having specificity to pd l1 to treat cancer it is also possible that we failed to identify or may in the future fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications held by third parties that cover our drug candidates publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries therefore we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications on our drug candidates or for their uses or that our drug candidates will not infringe patents that are currently issued or that are issued in the future in the event that a third party has also filed a patent application covering one of our drug candidates or a similar invention our patent application may be regarded as a competing application and may not be approved in the end additionally pending patent applications that have been published can subject to certain limitations be later amended in a manner that could cover our products or their use if a third party were to assert claims of patent infringement against us even if we believe such third party claims are without merit a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third party patents are valid enforceable and infringed and the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the applicable product unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable similarly if any third party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our compositions formulations or methods of treatment prevention or use the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable in addition defending such claims would cause us to incur substantial expenses and could cause us to pay substantial damages if we are found to be infringing a third party 146 s patent rights these damages potentially include increased damages and attorneys 146 fees if we are found to have infringed such rights willfully in order to avoid or settle potential claims with respect to any patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may choose or be required to seek a license from a third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both which could be substantial these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a drug candidate or be forced by court order or otherwise to modify or cease some or all aspects of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened patent or other intellectual property claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms further we could be found liable for significant monetary damages as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement defending against claims of patent infringement misappropriation of trade secrets or other violations of intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming regardless of the outcome furthermore because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation thus even if we were to ultimately prevail or to settle at an early stage such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs issued patents covering one or more of our drug candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court despite measures we take to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property rights with respect to our drug candidates our intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated for example if we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our drug candidates the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and or unenforceable grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements for example lack of novelty obviousness or non enablement grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the uspto sipo or the applicable foreign table of contents counterpart or made a misleading statement during prosecution although we believe that we have conducted our patent prosecution in accordance with a duty of candor and in good faith the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable if a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and or unenforceability we would lose at least part and perhaps all of the patent protection on a drug candidate even if a defendant does not prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and or unenforceability our patent claims may be construed in a manner that would limit our ability to enforce such claims against the defendant and others even if we establish infringement the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages which may not be an adequate remedy in addition if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents is threatened it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license develop or commercialize our current or future drug candidates any loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on one or more of our drug candidates and our business enforcing our intellectual property rights against third parties may also cause such third parties to file other counterclaims against us which could be costly to defend and could require us to pay substantial damages cease the sale of certain drugs or enter into a license agreement and pay royalties which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all intellectual property litigation may lead to unfavorable publicity which may harm our reputation and cause the market price of our adss to decline and any unfavorable outcome from such litigation could limit our research and development activities and or our ability to commercialize our drug candidates during the course of any intellectual property litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings rulings on motions and other interim proceedings in the litigation if securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative the perceived value of our drug candidates future drugs programs or intellectual property could be diminished accordingly the market price of our adss may decline such announcements could also harm our reputation or the market for our drug candidates which could have a material adverse effect on our business in the event of intellectual property litigation there can be no assurance that we would prevail even if the case against us is weak or flawed if third parties successfully assert their intellectual property rights against us prohibitions against using certain technologies or prohibitions against commercializing our drug candidates could be imposed by a court or by a settlement agreement between us and a plaintiff in addition if we are unsuccessful in defending against allegations that we have infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated the patent or other intellectual property rights of others we may be forced to pay substantial damage awards to the plaintiff additionally we may be required to obtain a license from the intellectual property owner in order to continue our research and development programs or to commercialize any resulting product it is possible that the necessary license will not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all this may not be technically or commercially feasible may render our products less competitive or may delay or prevent the launch of our products to the market any of the foregoing could limit our research and development activities our ability to commercialize one or more drug candidates or both most of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources they are therefore likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation longer than we could in addition the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to conduct our clinical trials continue our internal research programs in license needed technology or enter into strategic partnerships that would help us bring our drug candidates to market in addition any future intellectual property litigation interference or other administrative proceedings will result in additional expense and distraction of our personnel an adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us or any future strategic partners to loss of our proprietary position expose us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business table of contents changes in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general thereby impairing our ability to protect our drug candidates as is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property particularly patent rights obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly time consuming and inherently uncertain in addition the united states has recently enacted and is implementing wide ranging patent reform legislation recent u s supreme court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations in addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained if any depending on decisions by the u s congress the federal courts and the uspto the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future for example in a recent case assoc for molecular pathology v myriad genetics inc the u s supreme court held that certain claims to naturally occurring substances are not patentable although we do not believe that our currently issued patents and any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications directed to our drug candidates if issued in their currently pending forms as well as patent rights licensed by us will be found invalid based on this decision we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts the u s congress or the uspto may impact the value of our patent rights there could be similar changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions that may impact the value of our patent rights or our other intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets our business and competitive position would be harmed we also may be subject to claims that our employees consultants or advisers have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property in addition to our issued patents and pending patent applications we rely on trade secret and confidential information including unpatented know how technology and other proprietary information to maintain our competitive position and to protect our drug candidates we seek to protect this trade secret and confidential information in part by entering into non disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to them such as our employees corporate collaborators outside scientific collaborators sponsored researchers contract manufacturers consultants advisers and other third parties we also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants however any of these parties may breach such agreements and disclose our proprietary information and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us and our competitive position would be harmed furthermore many of our employees consultants and advisers including our senior management were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors some of these employees consultants and advisers including members of our senior management executed proprietary rights non disclosure and non competition agreements in connection with such previous employment although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know how of others in their work for us we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property including trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such individual 146 s former employer we are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning the agreements with our senior management but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management in addition while we typically require our employees consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own and furthermore the assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self executing or the assignment agreements may be breached each of which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property if we fail in prosecuting or defending any such table of contents claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable intellectual property rights even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs be a distraction to our management and scientific personnel and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in licenses because our programs may involve additional drug candidates that may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire and maintain licenses or other rights to use these proprietary rights we may be unable to acquire or in license any compositions methods of use or other intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify the licensing and acquisition of third party intellectual property rights is a competitive area and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary these established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities in addition companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us we also may be unable to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have we may have to abandon development of the relevant program or drug candidate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects for growth our rights to develop and commercialize our drug candidates are subject in part to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others we rely on licenses to certain patent rights and other intellectual property from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of our drug candidates these and other licenses may not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our drug products as a result we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and commercializing competitive drug products in territories included in all of our licenses we may not have the right to control the preparation filing prosecution maintenance enforcement and defense of patents and patent applications covering the drug candidates that we license from third parties moreover we have not had and do not have primary control over these activities for certain of our patents or patent applications and other intellectual property rights that we jointly own with certain of our licensors and sub licensors therefore we cannot be certain that these patents and patent applications will be prepared filed prosecuted maintained enforced and defended in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business if our licensors fail to prosecute maintain enforce and defend such patents or lose rights to those patents or patent applications the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated and our right to develop and commercialize any of our drugs that are subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected pursuant to the terms of the license agreements with some of our licensors the licensors may have the right to control enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity or unenforceability of these patents even if we are permitted to pursue the enforcement or defense of our licensed patents we will require the cooperation of our licensors and any applicable patent owners and such cooperation may not be provided to us we cannot be certain that our licensors will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize their or our enforcement of such patents or defense of such claims to protect our interests in the licensed patents even if we are not a party to these legal actions an adverse outcome could harm our business because it might prevent us from continuing to license intellectual property that we may need to operate our business if we lose any of our licensed intellectual property our right to develop and commercialize any of our drug candidates that are subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected in addition our licensors may have relied on third party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties such that our licensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in license this could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial conditions results of operations table of contents in spite of our best efforts our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements thereby removing our ability to develop and commercialize drug products covered by these license agreements if such licenses are terminated we may be required seek alternative in license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or may be non exclusive if these in licenses are terminated or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity we may need to modify or cease the development manufacture and commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates and competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of and to market products identical to ours in addition we may seek to obtain additional licenses from our licensors and in connection with obtaining such licenses we may agree to amend our existing licenses in a manner that may be more favorable to the licensors including by agreeing to terms that could enable third parties potentially including our competitors to receive licenses to a portion of the intellectual property that is subject to our existing licenses any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial conditions results of operations and prospects if we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors we could be required to pay monetary damages or could lose license rights that are important to our business our business relies in large part on our ability to develop and commercialize drug candidates we have licensed from third parties and we have entered into license agreements with third parties providing us with rights to various third party intellectual property including rights in patents and patent applications our licenses may not encumber all intellectual property rights owned or controlled by the affiliates of our licensors and relevant to our drug candidates and we may need to obtain additional licenses from our existing licensors and others to advance our research or allow commercialization of drug candidates we may develop in such case we may need to obtain additional licenses which may not be available on an exclusive basis on commercially reasonable terms or at a reasonable cost if at all in that event we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our drug candidates or the methods for manufacturing them or to develop or license replacement technology all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis if we are unable to do so we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected drug candidates which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects significantly in addition if our licensors breach the license agreements we may not be able to enforce such agreements against our licensors 146 parent entity or affiliates under each of our license and intellectual property related agreements in exchange for licensing or sublicensing us the right to develop and commercialize the applicable drug candidates our licensors will be eligible to receive from us milestone payments tiered royalties from commercial sales of such drug candidates assuming relevant approvals from government authorities are obtained or other payments our license and intellectual property related agreements also require us to comply with other obligations including development and diligence obligations providing certain information regarding our activities with respect to such drug candidates and or maintaining the confidentiality of information we receive from our licensors if we fail to comply with our obligations under our current or future license agreements our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements and upon the effective date of such termination have the right to re obtain the licensed and sub licensed technology and intellectual property if any of our licensors terminate any of our licenses we might not be able to develop manufacture or market any drug or drug candidate that is covered by the licenses provided for under these agreements and other third parties may be able to market drug candidates similar or identical to ours in such case we may have to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms and may be required to provide a grant back license to the licensors under our own intellectual property with respect to the terminated products we may also face claims for monetary damages or other penalties under these agreements while we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us including seeking to cure any breach by us and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the intellectual property rights licensed and sublicensed to us we may not be able to do so in a timely manner at an acceptable cost or at all in particular some of the milestone payments are payable upon our drug candidates reaching development milestones before we have commercialized or received any revenue from sales of such drug candidate and we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient resources to make such milestone payments any uncured material breach under the license agreements could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our rights to the table of contents applicable drug candidate any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects it is possible that we may be unable to obtain any additional licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms if at all certain of our license agreements also require us to meet development thresholds to maintain the license including establishing a set timeline for developing and commercializing products disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement including the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation related issues the extent to which our technology and processes infringe misappropriate or violate intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the license agreement the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners and the priority of invention of patented technology in addition the agreements under which we license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations the resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects moreover if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected drug candidates which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects intellectual property rights do not necessarily protect us from all potential threats to our competitive advantage the degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage the following examples are illustrative others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our drug candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or may in the future exclusively license which could result in the patents applied for not being issued or being invalidated after issuing we might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions which could result in the patents applied for not being issued or being invalidated after issuing others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by our competitors or other third parties we may obtain patents for certain compounds many years before we receive regulatory approval for drugs containing such compounds and because patents have a limited life which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related drugs the commercial value of our patents may be limited our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive drugs for commercialization in our major markets we may fail to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable table of contents we may fail to apply for or obtain adequate intellectual property protection in all the jurisdictions in which we operate third parties may gain unauthorized access to our intellectual property due to potential lapses in our information the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business for example by preventing us from commercializing one or more of our drug candidates for one or more indications any of the aforementioned threats to our competitive advantage could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects if our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our competitive position may be adversely affected we own registered trademarks we may not be able to obtain trademark protection in territories that we consider of significant importance to us in addition any of our trademarks or trade names whether registered or unregistered may be challenged opposed infringed cancelled circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks as applicable we may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names which we will need to build name recognition by potential collaborators or customers in our markets of interest over the long term if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected terms of our future patents may not be sufficient to effectively protect our drug candidates and business in many countries where we file applications for patents the term of an issued patent is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non provisional patent application in the applicable country although various extensions may be available the life of a patent and the protection it affords are limited even if we obtain patents covering our drug candidates we may still be open to competition from other companies as well as generic medications once the patent life has expired for a drug while there are patent regulations in the prc in respect of regulatory data protection of new drugs containing new chemical components there are currently no other clear mechanisms providing patent term extension or patent linkages for other drugs in the prc therefore it is possible that a lower cost generic drug can emerge onto the market much more quickly prc regulators have set out a framework for integrating patent linkage and data exclusivity into the prc regulatory regime as well as for establishing a pilot program for patent term extension this framework will require adoption of regulations to be implemented although no such regulations have been issued to date these factors may result in weaker protection for us against generic competition in the prc than could be available to us in other jurisdictions such as the united states in addition patents which we expect to obtain in the prc may not be eligible to be extended for patent terms lost during clinical trials and the regulatory review process if we are unable to obtain patent term extensions or if such extensions are less than requested for our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expirations and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed as a result if we do not obtain additional protection under the hatch waxman amendments and similar legislation in other countries extending the terms of our patents if issued relating to our drug candidates our business may be materially harmed depending upon the timing duration and specifics of fda regulatory approval for our drug candidates one or more of our u s patents if issued may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 the 147 hatch waxman amendments 148 the hatch waxman amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during drug development and the fda regulatory review process patent term extensions however cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of drug approval by the fda and only one patent can be extended for a particular drug the application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the uspto in conjunction with the fda we may not be granted an extension because of for example failing to apply within applicable deadlines failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements moreover the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request if we are unable to obtain a table of contents patent term extension for a given patent or the term of any such extension is less than we request the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our drug will be shortened and our competitors may obtain earlier approval of competing drugs and our ability to generate revenues could be materially adversely affected risks related to our industry business and operations our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate senior management and qualified scientific employees we are highly dependent on the expertise of the members of our research and development team as well as the principal members of our management we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers but each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time with prior written notice in addition we currently do not have 147 key man 148 insurance for any of our executive officers or other key personnel recruiting retaining and motivating qualified management scientific clinical manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success the loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy further replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop gain regulatory approval of and commercialize drugs competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous biopharmaceutical companies for similar personnel we also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions in addition our management will be required to devote significant time to new compliance initiatives from our status as a public company which may require us to recruit more management personnel we will need to increase the size and capabilities of our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing our growth we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and consultants and the scope of our operations particularly in the areas of clinical development regulatory affairs and business development to manage our anticipated future growth we must continue to implement and improve our managerial operational and financial systems expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel due to our limited financial resources we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel the expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business the data and information that we gather in our research and development process could be inaccurate or incomplete which could harm our business reputation financial condition and results of operations we collect aggregate process and analyze data and information from our pre clinical studies manufacturing technology development programs and clinical programs we also engage in substantial information gathering following the identification of a promising drug candidate because data in the healthcare industry is fragmented in origin inconsistent in format and often incomplete the overall quality of data collected or accessed in the healthcare industry is often subject to challenge the degree or amount of data which is knowingly or unknowingly absent or omitted can be material and we often discover data issues and errors when monitoring and auditing the quality of our data if we make mistakes in the capture input or analysis of these data our ability to advance the development of our drug candidates may be materially harmed and our business prospects and reputation may suffer we also engage in the procurement of regulatory approvals necessary for the development and commercialization of our products under development for which we manage and submit data to governmental entities these processes and submissions are governed by complex data processing and validation policies and regulations notwithstanding such policies and regulations interim top line or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data in which case we may be exposed to table of contents liability to a customer court or government agency that concludes that our storage handling submission delivery or display of health information or other data was wrongful or erroneous although we maintain insurance coverage for clinical trials this coverage may prove to be inadequate or could cease to be available to us on acceptable terms if at all even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time attention and resources a claim brought against us that is uninsured or under insured could harm our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we rely on cros our partners and other third parties to monitor and manage data for some of our ongoing pre clinical and clinical programs and control only certain aspects of their activities if any of our cros our partners or other third parties does not perform to our standards in terms of data accuracy or completeness data from those pre clinical and clinical trials may be compromised as a result and our reliance on these parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities for a detailed discussion see 147 151 risks related to our reliance on third parties 151 as we rely on third parties to conduct our pre clinical studies and clinical trials if we lose our relationships with these third parties or if they do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our drug candidates and our business could be substantially harmed 148 above we may be subject to liability lawsuits arising from our clinical trials we currently carry liability insurance covering our clinical trials although we maintain such insurance any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered in whole or in part by our insurance or which is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage our insurance policies also contain various exclusions and we may be subject to particular liability claims for which we have no coverage we will have to pay any amount awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance and we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient capital to pay such amounts in addition if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against such claims we may incur substantial liabilities and be required to suspend or delay our ongoing clinical trials even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources regardless of the merits or eventual outcome liability claims may result in significant negative consequences to our business and prospects including but not limited to decreased demand for our drug candidates or any resulting products injury to our reputation withdrawal of other clinical trial participants costs to defend the related litigation a diversion of our management 146 s time and resources substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients inability to commercialize our drug candidates and a decline in the market price of our adss we have limited insurance coverage and any claims beyond our insurance coverage may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources we maintain insurance policies that are required under prc laws and regulations as well as insurance based on our assessment of our operational needs and industry practice we also maintain liability insurance covering our clinical trials in line with industry practice in the prc we have elected not to maintain certain types of insurances such as business interruption insurance or key man insurance our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any claim for product liability damage to our fixed assets or employee injuries any liability or damage to or caused by our facilities or our personnel beyond our insurance coverage may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources disruptions in the financial markets and economic conditions could affect our ability to raise capital global economies could suffer dramatic downturns as the result of a deterioration in the credit markets and related financial crisis as well as a variety of other factors including extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability ratings downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others in the past governments have taken unprecedented actions in an attempt to address and rectify these extreme market and table of contents economic conditions by providing liquidity and stability to the financial markets if these actions are not successful the return of adverse economic conditions may cause a significant impact on our ability to raise capital if needed on a timely basis and on acceptable terms or at all in addition there is considerable uncertainty over the long term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world 146 s leading economies including the united states and china there have been concerns over unrest and terrorist threats in the middle east europe and africa and over the conflicts involving ukraine syria and north korea there have also been concerns on the relationship among china and other asian countries which may result in or intensify potential conflicts in relation to territorial disputes or the trade related disputes between the united states and china in addition the u k held a referendum on june 23 2016 on its membership in the european union in which a majority of voters in the u k voted to exit the european union commonly referred to as 147 brexit 148 the u k 146 s departure from the european union remains uncertain brexit could adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets it is unclear whether these challenges and uncertainties will be contained or resolved and what effects they may have on the global political and economic conditions in the long term our employees independent contractors consultants commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including non compliance with regulatory standards and requirements we are exposed to the risk of fraud misconduct or other illegal activities by our employees independent contractors consultants commercial partners and vendors misconduct by these parties could include intentional reckless and negligent conduct that fails to comply with the laws of the nmpa the fda and other comparable regulatory authorities provide true complete and accurate information to the nmpa the fda and other comparable regulatory authorities comply with manufacturing standards we have established comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the prc the united states and similar fraudulent misconduct laws in other applicable jurisdictions or report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us for example our founder dr jingwu zhang zang was the corresponding author of a research paper prepared by scientists at gsk china 146 s research center and published in nature medicine in 2010 the paper was retracted in 2013 as a result of misrepresentation of certain data for which dr zang admitted his management oversight accepted the responsibility as the corresponding author and coordinated the retraction of the paper in addition dr zang received a warning letter from the fda in march 1999 relating to the lack of ind approval before the initiation of a clinical research study in human subjects for details please see 147 management 151 certain past incidents 148 we cannot assure you that there will not be any inquiries investigations or other actions against dr zang by any regulatory or government authorities or any negative publicity against dr zang or us regarding these incidents any of which could distract dr zang and our management 146 s attention and negatively affect our business and results of operations if we obtain approval of any of our drug candidates and begin commercializing those drugs in the prc the united states or other applicable jurisdictions our potential exposure under the laws of such jurisdictions will increase significantly and our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase these laws may impact among other things our current activities with principal investigators and research patients as well as future sales marketing and education programs in particular the promotion sales and marketing of healthcare items and services as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud kickbacks self dealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion structuring and commission s certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation table of contents it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other parties and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions if we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships this may increase our capital requirements dilute the value of your investment in our adss cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks we may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic partnerships including licensing or acquiring complementary products intellectual property rights technologies or businesses any potential acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks including but not limited to increased operating expenses and cash requirements the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities the issuance of our equity securities assimilation of operations intellectual property and products of an acquired company including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel the diversion of our management 146 s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition retention of key employees the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business risks and uncertainties associated with the assimilation of operations corporate culture and personnel of the acquired risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction including the prospects of that party and its existing drugs or drug candidates and regulatory approvals our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs and changes in accounting principles relating to recognition and measurement of our investments that may have a significant impact on our financial results in addition if we undertake acquisitions we may issue dilutive securities assume or incur debt obligations incur large one time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense moreover we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business if we fail to comply with applicable anti bribery laws our reputation may be harmed and we could be subject to penalties and significant expenses that have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to anti bribery laws in china that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage in addition although currently our primary operating business is in china we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the 147 fcpa 148 the fcpa generally prohibits us from making improper payments to non u s officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and our agents comply with anti bribery laws there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will prevent our agents employees and intermediaries from engaging in bribery activities failure to comply with anti bribery laws could disrupt our business and lead to severe criminal and civil penalties including imprisonment criminal and civil fines loss of our export licenses suspension of our ability to do business with the government denial of government reimbursement for our products and or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs other remedial measures could include further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls and potential personnel changes and or disciplinary actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity we could also be adversely affected by any allegation that we violated such laws table of contents any failure to comply with applicable regulations and industry standards or obtain various licenses and permits could harm our reputation and our business results of operations and prospects a number of governmental agencies or industry regulatory bodies in the prc the united states and other applicable jurisdictions impose strict rules regulations and industry standards governing biopharmaceutical research and development activities which apply to us our or our cros 146 failure to comply with such regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research administrative penalties imposed by regulatory bodies or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our business reputation prospects for future work and results of operations for example if we or our cros were to treat research animals inhumanely or in violation of international standards set out by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care it could revoke any such accreditation and the accuracy of our animal research data could be questioned if we or our cros or other contractors or consultants fail to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business we and third parties such as our cros or other contractors or consultants are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials our operations also produce hazardous waste products we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed our resources we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties although we maintain workers 146 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of or exposure to hazardous materials this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage use or disposal of biological hazardous or radioactive materials in addition we may be required to incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations these current or future laws and regulations may impair our research development or production efforts failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions if we face allegations of non compliance with laws and encounter sanctions our reputation revenues and liquidity may suffer and our drug candidates and future drugs could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market any government investigation of alleged violations of laws could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenues from our drugs if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected additionally if we are unable to generate revenues from our product sales our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased our internal computer systems or those used by our cros or other contractors or consultants may fail or suffer security breaches although to our knowledge we have not experienced any material system failure or security breach to date if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations for example the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data likewise we partially rely on our third party research institution collaborators for research and development of our drug candidates and other third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business table of contents to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our drug candidates could be delayed failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations related to privacy or data security could lead to government enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal fines or penalties private litigation other liabilities and or adverse publicity compliance or the failure to comply with such laws could increase the costs of our products and services could limit their use or adoption and could otherwise negatively affect our operating results and business the regulatory framework for the collection use safeguarding sharing transfer and other processing of personal information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future regulatory authorities in virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate have implemented and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning personal data protection regulatory authorities in china have implemented and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection for example china 146 s cyber security law which became effective in june 2017 created china 146 s first national level data protection for 147 network operators 148 which may include all organizations in china that provide services over the internet or another information network numerous regulations guidelines and other measures are expected to be adopted under the umbrella of the cyber security law drafts of some of these measures have now been published including the draft rules on cross border transfers published by the china cyberspace administration in 2017 which may upon enactment require security review before transferring human health related data out of china in addition certain industry specific laws and regulations affect the collection and transfer of personal data in china for example the prc state council promulgated regulations on the administration of human genetic resources effective in july 2019 which require approval from the science and technology administration department of the state council where human genetic resources or hgr are involved in any international collaborative project and additional approval for any export or cross border transfer of the hgr samples or associated data it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices potentially resulting in confiscation of hgr samples and associated data and administrative fines in addition the interpretation and application of data protection laws in china and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux in the united states we are subject to laws and regulations that address privacy personal information protection and data security at both the federal and state levels numerous laws and regulations including security breach notification laws health information privacy laws and consumer protection laws govern the collection use disclosure and protection of health related and other personal information given the variability and evolving state of these laws we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by regulators or courts in their interpretation regulatory authorities in europe have implemented and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection for example the general data protection regulation eu 2016 679 or gdpr which became effective in may 2018 imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the gdpr such as us including but not limited to requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal information relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the european economic area including to the united states providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information keeping personal information secure having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information responding to individuals 146 requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals and recordkeeping the gdpr substantially increases the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non compliance including fines of up to 10 000 000 euros or up to 2 of our total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses or up to 20 000 000 euros or up to 4 of our total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses given the new law we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law national laws of member states of the european union are in the process of being adapted to the requirements under the gdpr because the gdpr table of contents specifically gives member states flexibility with respect to certain matters national laws may partially deviate from the gdpr and impose different obligations from country to country leading to additional complexity and uncertainty we expect that we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with evolving obligations under global data protection privacy and security laws will be sufficient any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in reputational damage or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities individuals or others these proceedings or actions could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties and negative publicity result in the delayed or halted transfer or confiscation of certain personal information require us to change our business practices increase our costs and materially harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations in addition our current and future relationships with customers vendors pharmaceutical partners and other third parties could be negatively affected by any proceedings or actions against us or current or future data protection obligations imposed on them under applicable law including the gdpr in addition a data breach affecting personal information including health information could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damage that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses natural disasters acts of war or terrorism or other factors beyond our control may adversely affect the economy infrastructure and livelihood of the people in the regions where we conduct our business our operations may be under the threat of floods earthquakes sandstorms snowstorms fire or drought power water or fuel shortages failures malfunction and breakdown of information management systems unexpected maintenance or technical problems or may be susceptible to potential wars or terrorist attacks serious natural disasters may result in loss of lives injury destruction of assets and disruption of our business and operations acts of war or terrorism may also injure our employees cause loss of lives disrupt our business network and destroy our markets any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business sentiment and environment cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business financial conditions and results of operations we have identified two material weaknesses in our internal controls and if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls to remediate our material weaknesses over financial reporting we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations meet our reporting obligations or prevent fraud prior to this offering we have been a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls in the course of auditing our consolidated financial statements we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified two material weaknesses and control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in the standards established by the u s public company accounting oversight board a 147 material weakness 148 is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company 146 s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weaknesses that have been identified relate to i our lack of sufficient and competent financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of u s gaap and the reporting and compliance requirements of the united states securities and exchange commission or the sec to formalize key controls over financial reporting and to prepare consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and ii our lack of sufficient documented financial closing policies and procedures specifically those related to a accounting for licensing and collaboration agreements and b period end expenses cut off and accruals these material weaknesses if not timely remedied may lead to significant misstatements in our consolidated financial statements in the future following the identification of the material weaknesses and other control deficiencies we have taken measures and plan to continue to take measures to remediate these deficiencies see 147 management 146 s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 151 internal control over financial reporting 148 however the implementation of those measures may not fully remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner our failure to correct these deficiencies or our failure to discover and address any other deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting table of contents requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis moreover ineffective internal control over financial reporting could significantly hinder our ability to prevent fraud upon the completion of this offering we will become subject to the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act or section 404 requires that we include a report from management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form 20 f beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending december 31 2020 in addition once we cease to be an 147 emerging growth company 148 as defined in the jobs act our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective moreover even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm after conducting its own independent testing may issue an adverse report if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented designed operated or reviewed or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us in addition once we have become a public company our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future we may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation during the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section 404 we may identify other weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in addition if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as these standards are modified supplemented or amended from time to time we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 if we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information this could limit our access to capital markets adversely affect our results of operations and lead to a decline in the trading price of the adss additionally ineffective internal controls could expose us to an increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list or to other regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions we could also be required to restate our historical financial statements our auditor like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in china is not permitted to be subject to inspection by public company accounting oversight board and consequently investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection our auditor the independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report included elsewhere in this registration statement as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the united states and a firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board united states or pcaob is subject to laws in the united states pursuant to which the pcaob conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with applicable professional standards our auditor is located in and organized under the laws of the prc which is a jurisdiction where the pcaob has been unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the chinese authorities in may 2013 pcaob announced that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding on enforcement cooperation with the csrc and the prc ministry of finance which establishes a cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations undertaken by pcaob the csrc or the prc ministry of finance in the united states and the prc respectively pcaob continues to be in discussions with the china securities regulatory commission or csrc and the prc ministry of finance to permit joint inspections in china of audit firms that are registered with pcaob and audit chinese companies that trade on u s exchanges on december 7 2018 the sec and the pcaob issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by the u s regulators in their oversight of financial statement audits of u s listed companies with significant operations in china however it remains unclear what further actions if any the sec and pcaob will take to address the problem this lack of pcaob inspections in china prevents the pcaob from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of our independent registered public accounting firm as a result we and investors in our ordinary shares are deprived of the benefits of such pcaob inspections the inability of the pcaob to conduct inspections of auditors in china makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public table of contents accounting firm 146 s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of china that are subject to pcaob inspections which could cause investors and potential investors in our stock to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements proceedings instituted by the sec against 147 big four 148 prc based accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act starting in 2011 147 big four 148 prc based accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm were affected by a conflict between u s and chinese law specifically for certain u s listed companies operating and audited in mainland china the sec and the pcaob sought to obtain from the chinese firms access to their audit work papers and related documents the firms were however advised and directed that under chinese law they could not respond directly to the u s regulators on those requests and that requests by foreign regulators for access to such papers in china had to be channeled through the csrc in late 2012 this impasse led the sec to commence administrative proceedings under rule 102 e of its rules of practice and also under the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 against the chinese accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm a first instance trial of the proceedings in july 2013 in the sec 146 s internal administrative court resulted in an adverse judgment against the firms the administrative law judge proposed penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice before the sec although that proposed penalty did not take effect pending review by the commissioners of the sec on february 6 2015 before a review by the commissioner had taken place the firms reached a settlement with the sec under the settlement the sec accepted that future requests by the sec for the production of documents will normally be made to the csrc the firms were to receive matching section 106 requests and were required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such requests which in substance require them to facilitate production via the csrc if they failed to meet specified criteria the sec retained authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure under the terms of the settlement the underlying proceeding against the four china based accounting firms was deemed dismissed with prejudice four years after entry of the settlement the four year mark occurred on february 6 2019 while we cannot predict if the sec will further challenge the four china based accounting firms 146 compliance with u s law in connection with u s regulatory requests for audit work papers or if the results of such a challenge would result in the sec imposing penalties such as suspensions if additional remedial measures are imposed on the 147 big four 148 prc based accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm we could be unable to timely file future financial statements in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act in the event the 147 big four 148 prc based accounting firms become subject to additional legal challenges by the sec or pcaob depending upon the final outcome listed companies in the united states with major prc operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in china which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act including possible delisting moreover any negative news about any such future proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding china based u s listed companies and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected if our independent registered public accounting firm was denied even temporarily the ability to practice before the sec and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act such a determination could ultimately lead to the delisting of the adss from the nasdaq global market or deregistration from the sec or both which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of the adss in the united states our reputation is important to our business success negative publicity may adversely affect our reputation and business prospects any negative publicity concerning us our affiliates or any entity that shares the 147 i mab 148 name even if untrue could adversely affect our reputation and business prospects there can be no assurance that negative publicity about us table of contents or any of our affiliates or any entity that shares the 147 i mab 148 name would not damage our brand image or have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition negative publicity with respect to us our management employees business partners affiliates or our industry may materially and adversely affect our reputation business results of operations and prospect our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate negative publicity about us such as alleged misconduct or improper activities or negative rumors relating to us our management employees business partners or affiliates can harm our business and results of operations even if they are unsubstantiated or are satisfactorily addressed for example a number of media reported that our founder dr jingwu zhang zang was involved in misrepresentation of certain data in a research paper prepared by scientists at gsk china 146 s research center and published in nature medicine in 2010 for which dr zang was the corresponding author and consequently dr zang was dismissed by gsk in 2013 in addition dr zang received a warning letter from the fda in march 1999 relating to the lack of ind approval before the initiation of a clinical research study in human subjects for details please see 147 management 151 certain past incidents 148 to the best of our knowledge dr zang was not and is not subject to any legal or regulatory charges proceedings or disciplinary actions in connection with these incidents or by relevant parties involved in the incidents however we cannot assure you that there will not be any inquiries investigations or other actions against dr zang by any regulatory or government authorities in the future any regulatory inquiries or investigations or other actions against dr zang or our other management any perceived unethical fraudulent or inappropriate business conduct by us or perceived wrong doing by any key member of our management team or other employees our business partners or our affiliates could harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business regardless of the merits or final outcome of any such regulatory inquiries or investigations or other actions our reputation may be substantially damaged which may impede our ability to attract and retain talents and business partners and grow our business moreover any negative media publicity about the biopharmaceutical industry in general or product or service quality problems of other companies in the industry including our peers may also negatively impact our reputation if we are unable to maintain a good reputation our ability to attract and retain key employees and business partners could be harmed which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and prospect change in business prospects of acquisitions may result in impairment to our goodwill which could negatively affect our reported results of operations we acquired a controlling interest in i mab tianjin in july 2017 and the remaining interest in i mab tianjin in may 2018 in connection with our acquisition of i mab tianjin we identified rmb148 8 million of intangible assets and rmb162 6 million of goodwill of i mab tianjin attributable to core technology and synergy effects expected from combining the operations of the discovery and development of innovative biologics and the development of clinical stage biologics we are required to test our goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired goodwill is allocated to cash generating units or groups of cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing an impairment loss of goodwill is recognized for the amount by which the relevant cash generating unit 146 s or group of cash generating unit 146 s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount and we would be required to write down the carrying value of our goodwill during the period in which it is determined to be impaired which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations we are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory matters corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non compliance we are or will be subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies including for example once we have become a public company the sec which is charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded and the various regulatory authorities in china and the cayman islands and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities moreover because these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available this evolution may result in continuing table of contents uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed risks related to doing business in china the pharmaceutical industry in china is highly regulated and such regulations are subject to change which may affect approval and commercialization of our drugs our research and development operations and manufacturing facilities are in china which we believe confers clinical commercial and regulatory advantages the pharmaceutical industry in china is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision encompassing the approval registration manufacturing packaging licensing and marketing of new drugs see 147 regulation 148 for a discussion of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to our current and planned business activities in china in recent years the regulatory framework in china regarding the pharmaceutical industry has undergone significant changes and we expect that it will continue to undergo significant changes any such changes or amendments may result in increased compliance costs on our business or cause delays in or prevent the successful development or commercialization of our drug candidates in china and reduce the current benefits we believe are available to us from developing and manufacturing drugs in china prc authorities have become increasingly vigilant in enforcing laws in the pharmaceutical industry and any failure by us or our partners to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations or obtain and maintain required licenses and permits may result in the suspension or termination of our business activities in china we believe our strategy and approach are aligned with the prc government 146 s regulatory policies but we cannot ensure that our strategy and approach will continue to be aligned changes in the political and economic policies of the prc government may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to sustain our growth and expansion strategies a significant portion of our operations are in china our financial condition and results of operations are affected to a large extent by economic political and legal developments in china the prc economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects including the extent of government involvement level of development growth rate control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources although the prc government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises a substantial portion of productive assets in china is still owned by the government in addition the prc government continues to play a significant role in regulating industrial development by imposing industrial policies the prc government also exercises significant control over china 146 s economic growth by allocating resources controlling payment of foreign currency denominated obligations setting monetary policy regulating financial services and institutions and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies while the prc economy has experienced significant growth in the past four decades growth has been uneven both geographically and among various sectors of the economy the prc government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources some of these measures may benefit the overall prc economy but may also have a negative effect on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us in addition the prc government had in the past implemented certain measures including interest rate increases to control the pace of economic growth these measures may cause decreased economic activity in china which may adversely affect our business and results of operations more generally if the business environment in china deteriorates from the perspective of domestic or international investment our business in china may also be adversely affected there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of prc laws rules and regulations our primary business is governed by prc laws and regulations our primary business operation is supervised by relevant regulatory authorities in china the prc legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes and table of contents unlike the common law system prior court decisions can only be cited as reference and have limited precedential value additionally written statutes in the prc are often principle oriented and require detailed interpretations by the enforcement bodies to further apply and enforce such laws since 1979 the prc government has developed a comprehensive system of laws rules and regulations in relation to economic matters such as foreign investment corporate organization and governance commerce taxation and trade however the interpretation and enforcement of these laws rules and regulations involve uncertainties and may not be as consistent or predictable as in other more developed jurisdictions as these laws and regulations are continually evolving in response to changing economic and other conditions and because of the limited volume of published cases and their non binding nature any particular interpretation of prc laws and regulations may not be definitive moreover we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the prc legal system and regulatory structure such unpredictability towards our contractual property and procedural rights as well as our rights licensed approved or granted by the competent regulatory authority could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations in addition the prc legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules some of which are not published on a timely basis if at all and which may have a retroactive effect hence we may not be aware of violation of these policies and rules until after such violation has occurred further the legal protections available to us and our investors under these laws rules and regulations may be limited in addition any administrative or court proceedings in china may be protracted resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention since prc administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems these uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce various contracts we have entered into and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations you may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in china against us or our management named in the prospectus based on foreign laws we are a company incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands we conduct substantially all of our operations in china and substantially all of our assets are located in china in addition all our senior executive officers reside within china for a significant portion of the time and some of them are prc nationals as a result it may be difficult for you to effect service of process upon us or those persons inside china it may also be difficult for you to enforce in u s courts judgments obtained in u s courts based on the civil liability provisions of the u s federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors as none of them currently resides in the united states or has substantial assets located in the united states in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands or the prc would recognize or enforce judgments of u s courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the prc civil procedures law prc courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the prc civil procedures law based either on treaties between china and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions china does not have any treaties or other forms of written arrangement with the united states that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in addition according to the prc civil procedures law the prc courts will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of prc laws or national sovereignty security or the public interest as a result it is uncertain whether and on what basis a prc court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the united states we may be restricted from transferring our scientific data abroad on march 17 2018 the general office of the prc state council promulgated the measures for the management of scientific data or the scientific data measures which provide a broad definition of scientific data and relevant rules for the management of scientific data according to the scientific data measures enterprises in china must seek governmental approval before any scientific data involving a state secret may be transferred abroad or to foreign parties further any researcher conducting research funded at least in part by the prc government is required to submit relevant scientific data for management by the entity to which such researcher is affiliated before such data may be published in any foreign academic journal currently as the term 147 state secret 148 is not clearly defined there table of contents is no assurance that we can always obtain relevant approvals for sending scientific data such as the results of our pre clinical studies or clinical trials conducted within china abroad or to our foreign partners in china if we are unable to obtain the necessary approvals in a timely manner or at all our research and development of drug candidates may be hindered which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial conditions and prospects if relevant government authorities consider the transmission of our scientific data to be in violation of the requirements under the scientific data measures we may be subject to specific administrative penalties imposed by those government authorities changes in u s and international trade policies particularly with regard to china may adversely impact our business and operating results the u s government has recently made statements and taken certain actions that may lead to potential changes to u s and international trade policies including imposing several rounds of tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in china in march 2018 u s president donald j trump announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum entering the united states and in june 2018 announced further tariffs targeting goods imported from china it is unknown whether and to what extent tariffs or other new laws or regulations will be adopted or the effect that any such actions would have on us or our industry while we have not started commercialization of drug candidates any unfavorable government policies on international trade such as capital controls or tariffs may affect the demand for our drug products the competitive position of our drug products the hiring of scientists and other research and development personnel and import or export of raw materials in relation to drug development or prevent us from selling our drug products in certain countries if any new tariffs legislation and or regulations are implemented or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or in particular if the u s government takes retaliatory trade actions due to the recent u s china trade tension such changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are classified as a prc resident enterprise for prc income tax purposes such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non prc shareholders or ads holders under the prc enterprise income tax law and its implementation rules an enterprise established outside of the prc with 147 de facto management body 148 within china is considered a 147 resident enterprise 148 and will be subject to the enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25 the implementation rules define the term 147 de facto management body 148 as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business productions personnel accounts and properties of an enterprise in 2009 the sat issued the circular of the state administration of taxation on issues relating to identification of prc controlled overseas registered enterprises as resident enterprises in accordance with the de facto standards of organizational management or circular 82 which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the 147 de facto management body 148 of a prc controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in china although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by prc enterprises or prc enterprise groups not those controlled by prc individuals or foreigners the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the sat 146 s general position on how the 147 de facto management body 148 text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises according to circular 82 an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a prc enterprise or a prc enterprise group will be regarded as a prc tax resident by virtue of having its 147 de facto management body 148 in china and will be subject to prc enterprise income tax on its global income if all of the following conditions are met i the primary location of the day to day operational management is in china ii decisions relating to the enterprise 146 s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in china iii the enterprise 146 s primary assets accounting books and records company seals and board and shareholder resolutions are located or maintained in china and iv at least 50 of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in china our prc counsel junhe llp has advised us that based on its understanding of the current prc laws and regulations i mab should not be considered as a prc resident enterprise for prc tax income purposes however the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the prc tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term 147 de facto management body 148 if the prc tax authorities determine that we are a prc resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes we could be subject to prc tax at a rate of 25 on our worldwide income which could materially reduce our net income and we may be required to withhold a 10 withholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non resident enterprises table of contents including the holders of our adss in addition non resident enterprise shareholders including our ads holders may be subject to prc tax at a rate of 10 on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of adss or ordinary shares if such income is treated as sourced from within china furthermore if we are deemed a prc resident enterprise dividends payable to our non prc individual shareholders including our ads holders and any gain realized on the transfer of adss or ordinary shares by such shareholders may be subject to prc tax at a rate of 20 in the case of non prc individuals which in the case of dividends may be withheld at source unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable tax treaty it is unclear whether non prc shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the prc in the event that we are treated as a prc resident enterprise any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in the adss or ordinary shares failure to renew our current leases or locate desirable alternatives for our leased properties could materially and adversely affect our business we lease properties for our offices and laboratories we may not be able to successfully extend or renew such leases upon expiration of the current term on commercially reasonable terms or at all and may therefore be forced to relocate our affected operations this could disrupt our operations and result in significant relocation expenses which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we compete with other businesses for premises at certain locations or of desirable sizes as a result even though we could extend or renew our leases rental payments may significantly increase as a result of the high demand for the leased properties in addition we may not be able to locate desirable alternative sites for our current leased properties as our business continues to grow and failure in relocating our affected operations could adversely affect our business and operations certain of our leasehold interests in leased properties have not been registered with the relevant prc governmental authorities as required by relevant prc laws the failure to register leasehold interests may expose us to potential fines we have not registered certain of our lease agreements with the relevant government authorities under the relevant prc laws and regulations we may be required to register and file with the relevant government authority executed leases the failure to register the lease agreements for our leased properties will not affect the validity of these lease agreements but the competent housing authorities may order us to register the lease agreements in a prescribed period of time and impose a fine ranging from rmb1 000 to rmb10 000 for each non registered lease if we fail to complete the registration within the prescribed timeframe we have granted and may continue to grant options and other types of awards under our share incentive plans which may result in increased share based compensation expenses we have adopted the second amended and restated 2017 employee stock option plan the 147 2017 plan 148 the second amended and restated 2018 employee stock option plan the 147 2018 plan 148 and the 2019 share incentive plan the 147 2019 plan 148 for the purpose of granting share based compensation awards to employees directors and consultants to incentivize their performance and align their interests with ours the 2019 plan will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering we recognize expenses in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u s gaap as of the date of this prospectus options to purchase a total of 9 450 315 ordinary shares and 10 991 671 ordinary shares have been granted and outstanding under the 2017 plan and 2018 plan respectively as of the date of this prospectus no award has been granted or outstanding under the 2019 plan see 147 management 151 share incentive plans 148 we believe the granting of share based compensation is of significant importance to our ability to attract and retain key personnel and employees and we will continue to grant share based compensation to employees in the future as a result our expenses associated with share based compensation may increase which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we may re evaluate the vesting schedules lock up period exercise price or other key terms applicable to the grants under our currently effective share incentive plans from time to time if we choose to do so we may experience substantial change in our share based compensation charges in the reporting periods following this offering fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment the value of rmb against the u s dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by among other things changes in political and economic conditions in china and by china 146 s foreign exchange policies on july 21 2005 table of contents the prc government changed its decade old policy of pegging the value of rmb to the u s dollar and rmb appreciated more than 20 against the u s dollar over the following three years between july 2008 and june 2010 this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between rmb and the u s dollar remained within a narrow band since june 2010 rmb has fluctuated against the u s dollar at times significantly and unpredictably on november 30 2015 the executive board of the international monetary fund completed the regular five year review of the basket of currencies that make up the special drawing right or the sdr and decided that with effect from october 1 2016 rmb is determined to be a freely usable currency and will be included in the sdr basket as a fifth currency along with the u s dollar the euro the japanese yen and the british pound in the fourth quarter of 2016 rmb has depreciated significantly in the backdrop of a surging u s dollar and persistent capital outflows of china this depreciation halted in 2017 and rmb appreciated approximately 7 against the u s dollar during this one year period with the development of the foreign exchange market and progress towards interest rate liberalization and rmb internationalization the prc government may in the future announce further changes to the exchange rate system and we cannot assure you that rmb will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the u s dollar in the future it is difficult to predict how market forces or prc or u s government policy may impact the exchange rate between rmb and the u s dollar in the future significant revaluation of rmb may have a material and adverse effect on your investment for example to the extent that we need to convert u s dollars we receive from this offering into rmb for our operations appreciation of rmb against the u s dollar would have an adverse effect on the rmb amount we would receive from the conversion conversely if we decide to convert our rmb into u s dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or adss or for other business purposes appreciation of the u s dollar against rmb would have a negative effect on the u s dollar amount available to us very limited hedging options are available in china to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations to date we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all in addition our currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert rmb into foreign currency in addition the prc government imposes controls on the convertibility of rmb into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of china we receive substantially all of our revenues in rmb under our current corporate structure our cayman islands holding company primarily relies on dividend payments from our prc subsidiary to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have under existing prc foreign exchange regulations payments of current account items including profit distributions interest payments and trade and service related foreign exchange transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of the state administration of foreign exchange or safe by complying with certain procedural requirements specifically under the existing exchange restrictions without prior approval of safe cash generated from the operations of our prc subsidiaries in china may be used to pay dividends to our company however approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where rmb is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of china to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies as a result we need to obtain safe approval to use cash generated from the operations of our prc subsidiaries to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than rmb owed to entities outside china or to make other capital expenditure payments outside china in a currency other than rmb in light of the flood of capital outflows of china the prc government may from time to time impose more restrictive foreign exchange policies and step up scrutiny of major outbound capital movement more restrictions and a substantial vetting process may be required by safe or other government authorities to regulate cross border transactions falling under the capital account the prc government may at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future if the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders including holders of our adss certain prc regulations may make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions the regulations on mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors or the m amp a rules adopted by six prc regulatory agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009 established additional procedures and table of contents requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex such regulation requires among other things that the ministry of commerce or mofcom be notified in advance of any change of control transaction in which a foreign investor acquires control of a prc domestic enterprise and involves any of the following circumstances i any important industry is concerned ii such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic security or iii such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or prc time honored brand we do not expect that this offering will trigger mofcom pre notification under each of the above mentioned circumstances or any review by other prc government authorities except as disclosed below in 147 151 the approval of the csrc may be required in connection with this offering and if required we cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain such approval 148 moreover the anti monopoly law promulgated by the standing committee of national people 146 s congress which became effective in 2008 requires that transactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds must be cleared by state administration for market regulation the 147 samr 148 the successive authority of mofcom before they can be completed we may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our prc subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have and any limitation on the ability of our prc subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business we are a cayman islands holding company and we may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our prc subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders and service any debt we may incur if any of our prc subsidiaries incur debt on its own behalf in the future the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us under prc laws and regulations our prc subsidiaries each of which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise may pay dividends only out of its respective accumulated profits as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations in addition a wholly foreign owned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10 of its after tax profits each year if any to fund a certain statutory reserve fund until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50 of its registered capital at its discretion a wholly foreign owned enterprise may allocate a portion of its after tax profits based on prc accounting standards to a staff welfare and bonus fund the reserve fund and staff welfare and bonus fund cannot be distributed to us as dividends our prc subsidiaries generate primarily all of their revenue in rmb which is not freely convertible into other currencies as result any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our prc subsidiaries to use their rmb revenues to pay dividends to us the prc government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and more restrictions and a substantial vetting process may be put forward by safe for cross border transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account any limitation on the ability of our prc subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other kinds of payments to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business pay dividends or otherwise fund and conduct our business in addition the prc enterprise income tax law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10 will be applicable to dividends payable by prc companies to non prc resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the prc central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non prc resident enterprises are incorporated prc regulations relating to offshore investment activities by prc residents may limit our prc subsidiaries 146 ability to change their registered capital or distribute profits to us or otherwise expose us or our prc resident beneficial owners to liability and penalties under prc laws in july 2014 safe promulgated the circular on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange control on domestic residents 146 offshore investment and financing and

foreign exchange administration policy on direct investment or safe notice 13 effective june 2015 under safe notice 13 applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign direct investments and outbound overseas direct investments including those required under safe circular 37 will be filed with qualified banks instead of safe the qualified banks will directly examine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of safe all of our shareholders who we are aware of being subject to the safe regulations have completed the initial registrations with the local safe branch or qualified banks as required by safe circular 37 however we may not be informed of the identities of all the prc residents holding direct or indirect interests in our company and we cannot provide any assurance that these prc residents will comply with our request to make or obtain any applicable registrations or continuously comply with all requirements under safe circular 37 or other related rules the failure or inability of the relevant shareholders to comply with the registration procedures set forth in these regulations may subject us to fines and legal sanctions such as restrictions on our cross border investment activities on the ability of our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china to distribute dividends and the proceeds from any reduction in capital share transfer or liquidation to us moreover failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liability under prc law for circumventing applicable foreign exchange restrictions as a result our business operations and our ability to distribute profits could be materially and adversely affected any failure to comply with prc regulations regarding our employee equity incentive plans may subject the prc plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions we and our directors executive officers and other employees who are prc citizens or who have resided in china for a continuous period of not less than one year and who will be granted restricted shares or options are subject to the notice on issues concerning the foreign exchange administration for domestic individuals participating in stock incentive plan of overseas publicly listed company issued by safe in february 2012 according to which employees directors supervisors and other management members participating in any share incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company who are prc citizens or who are non prc citizens residing in china for a continuous period of not less than one year subject to limited exceptions are required to register with safe through a domestic qualified agent which could be a prc subsidiary of such overseas listed company and complete certain other procedures in addition an overseas entrusted institution must be retained to handle matters in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options and the purchase or sale of shares and interests failure to complete the safe registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to make payments under our equity incentive plans or receive dividends or sales proceeds related thereto or our ability to contribute additional capital into our wholly foreign owned enterprises in china and limit our wholly foreign owned enterprises 146 ability to distribute dividends to us we also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt additional equity incentive plans for our directors and employees under prc law in addition the sat has issued circulars concerning employee share options or restricted shares under these circulars employees working in china who exercise share options or whose restricted shares vest will be subject to prc individual income tax the prc subsidiaries of an overseas listed company have obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees related to their share options or restricted shares if the employees fail to pay or the prc subsidiaries fail to withhold applicable income taxes the prc subsidiaries may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other prc government authorities table of contents prc regulation of loans to and direct investment in prc entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of this offering to make loans to our prc subsidiaries in china which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business we are an offshore holding company conducting our operations in china through our prc subsidiaries we may make loans to our prc subsidiaries subject to the approval from governmental authorities and limitation on the available loan amount or we may make additional capital contributions to our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china any loans to our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china which are treated as foreign invested enterprises under prc law are subject to prc regulations and foreign exchange loan registrations for example loans by us to our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterpart of safe in addition a foreign invested enterprise shall use its capital pursuant to the principle of authenticity and self use within its business scope the capital of a foreign invested enterprise shall not be used for the following purposes i directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations ii directly or indirectly used for investment in securities or investments other than banks 146 principal secured products unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations iii the granting of loans to non affiliated enterprises except where it is expressly permitted in the business license and iv paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self use except for the foreign invested real estate enterprises safe promulgated the notice of the state administration of foreign exchange on reforming the administration of foreign exchange settlement of capital of foreign invested enterprises or safe circular 19 effective june 2015 in replacement of the circular on the relevant operating issues concerning the improvement of the administration of the payment and settlement of foreign currency capital of foreign invested enterprises the notice from the state administration of foreign exchange on relevant issues concerning strengthening the administration of foreign exchange businesses and the circular on further clarification and regulation of the issues concerning the administration of certain capital account foreign exchange businesses according to safe circular 19 the flow and use of rmb capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign invested company is regulated such that rmb capital may not be used for the issuance of rmb entrusted loans the repayment of inter enterprise loans or the repayment of banks loans that have been transferred to a third party although safe circular 19 allows rmb capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign invested enterprise to be used for equity investments within china it also reiterates the principle that rmb converted from the foreign currency denominated capital of a foreign invested company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope thus it is unclear whether safe will permit such capital to be used for equity investments in china in actual practice safe promulgated the notice of the state administration of foreign exchange on reforming and standardizing the foreign exchange settlement management policy of capital account or safe circular 16 effective on june 9 2016 which reiterates some of the rules set forth in safe circular 19 but changes the prohibition against using rmb capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign invested company to issue rmb entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to non associated enterprises violations of safe circular 19 and safe circular 16 could result in administrative penalties safe circular 19 and safe circular 16 may significantly limit our ability to transfer any foreign currency we hold including the net proceeds from this offering to our prc subsidiaries which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in china in light of the various requirements imposed by prc regulations on loans to and direct investment in prc entities by offshore holding companies we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis if at all with respect to future loans to our prc subsidiaries or future capital contributions by us to our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china as a result uncertainties exist as to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our prc subsidiaries when needed if we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals our ability to use the proceeds we expect to receive from this offering and to capitalize or otherwise fund our prc operations may be negatively affected which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business table of contents we and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in prc resident enterprises or other assets attributable to a prc establishment of a non prc company on february 3 2015 the sat issued the bulletin on issues of enterprise income tax and indirect transfers of assets by non prc resident enterprises or bulletin 7 pursuant to this bulletin an 147 indirect transfer 148 of 147 prc taxable assets 148 including equity interests in a prc resident enterprise by non prc resident enterprises may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of prc taxable assets if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of prc enterprise income tax as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to prc enterprise income tax when determining whether there is a 147 reasonable commercial purpose 148 of the transaction arrangement factors to be taken into consideration include whether the main value of the equity interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives from prc taxable assets whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consist of direct or indirect investment in china or if its income mainly derives from china whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding prc taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function and risk exposure the duration of existence of the business model and organizational structure the replicability of the transaction by direct transfer of prc taxable assets and the tax situation of such indirect transfer and applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements on october 17 2017 the sat issued the announcement of the state administration of taxation on issues concerning the withholding of non resident enterprise income tax at source or bulletin 37 which came into effect on december 1 2017 bulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of non resident enterprise income tax late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest gains derived from the sale of shares by investors are not subject to the prc enterprise income tax pursuant to bulletin 7 where such shares were acquired in a transaction through a public stock exchange however the sale of adss or ordinary shares by a non prc resident enterprise outside a public stock exchange may be subject to prc enterprise income tax under bulletin 7 there are uncertainties as to the application of bulletin 7 bulletin 7 may be determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to the sale of the shares of our offshore subsidiaries or investments where prc taxable assets are involved the transferors and transferees may be subject to the tax filing and withholding or tax payment obligation while our prc subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing furthermore we our non resident enterprises and prc subsidiaries may be required to spend valuable resources to comply with bulletin 7 or to establish that we and our non resident enterprises should not be taxed under bulletin 7 for our previous and future restructuring or disposal of shares of our offshore subsidiaries which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the prc tax authorities have the discretion under bulletin 7 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the taxable assets transferred and the cost of investment if the prc tax authorities make adjustments to the taxable income of the transactions under bulletin 7 bulletin 37 our income tax costs associated with such potential acquisitions or disposals will increase which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the approval of the csrc may be required in connection with this offering and if required we cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain such approval the m amp a rules require overseas special purpose vehicles that are controlled by prc companies or individuals and formed for the purpose of seeking a public listing on an overseas stock exchange through acquisitions of prc domestic companies using shares of such special purpose vehicles or held by its shareholders as consideration to obtain the approval of the csrc prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle 146 s securities on an overseas stock exchange however the application of the m amp a rules remains unclear if csrc approval is required it is uncertain whether it would be possible for us to obtain the approval and any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining csrc approval for this offering would subject us to sanctions imposed by the csrc and other prc regulatory agencies our prc counsel has advised us based on their understanding of the current prc laws rules and regulations that the csrc 146 s approval may not be required for the listing and trading of our adss on the nasdaq stock market in the context of this offering given that i the csrc currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings like ours in this prospectus are subject to this regulation ii i mab tianjin was not table of contents acquired by a connected merger or by acquisition of equity interest or assets of a prc domestic company owned by prc companies or individuals as defined under the m amp a rules and iii i mab shanghai was incorporated as a wholly foreign owned enterprise by means of direct investment however our prc counsel has further advised us that there remain some uncertainties as to how the m amp a rules will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering and its opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the m amp a rules we cannot assure you that relevant prc government agencies including the csrc would reach the same conclusion as we do if it is determined that csrc approval is required for this offering we may face sanctions by the csrc or other prc regulatory agencies for failure to seek csrc approval for this offering these sanctions may include fines and penalties on our operations in china limitations on our operating privileges in china delays in or restrictions on the repatriation of the proceeds from this offering into the prc restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our subsidiaries in china or other actions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations reputation and prospects as well as the trading price of our adss the csrc or other prc regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us or making it advisable for us to halt this offering before the settlement and delivery of the adss that we are offering consequently if you engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to the settlement and delivery of the adss we are offering you would be doing so at the risk that the settlement and delivery may not occur in addition if the csrc or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for this offering we may be unable to obtain a waiver of such approval requirements if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver recent litigation and negative publicity surrounding china based companies listed in the u s may result in increased regulatory scrutiny of us and negatively impact the trading price of the adss and could have a material adverse effect upon our business including our results of operations financial condition cash flows and prospects we believe that litigation and negative publicity surrounding companies with operations in china that are listed in the u s have negatively impacted stock prices for such companies various equity based research organizations have published reports on china based companies after examining among other things their corporate governance practices related party transactions sales practices and financial statements that have led to special investigations and stock suspensions on national exchanges any similar scrutiny of us regardless of its lack of merit could result in a diversion of management resources and energy potential costs to defend ourselves against rumors decreases and volatility in the ads trading price and increased directors and officers insurance premiums and could have a material adverse effect upon our business including our results of operations financial condition cash flows and prospects risks related to our adss and this offering there has been no public market for our shares or adss prior to this offering and you may not be able to resell our adss at or above the price you paid or at all prior to this initial public offering there has been no public market for our shares or adss the adss have been approved for listing on the nasdaq stock market our shares will not be listed on any exchange or quoted for trading on any over the counter trading system if an active trading market for our adss does not develop after this offering the market price and liquidity of our adss will be materially and adversely affected negotiations with the underwriters will determine the initial public offering price for our adss which may bear no relationship to their market price after the initial public offering we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our adss will develop or that the market price of our adss will not decline below the initial public offering price the trading price of our adss may be volatile which could result in substantial losses to you the trading price of our adss can be volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control in addition the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with business operations located mainly in the prc that have listed their securities in the united states may affect the volatility in the price of and trading volumes for our adss some of these companies have experienced significant volatility the trading performances of these prc companies 146 securities may affect the overall investor sentiment towards other prc companies listed in the united states and consequently may impact the trading performance of our adss table of contents in addition to market and industry factors the price and trading volume for our adss may be highly volatile for specific business reasons including announcements of regulatory approval or a complete response letter or specific label indications or patient populations for a drug 146 s use or changes or delays in the regulatory review process announcements of therapeutic innovations new products acquisitions strategic relationships joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities any adverse changes to our relationship with manufacturers or suppliers the results of our testing and clinical trials the results of our efforts to acquire or license additional drug candidates variations in the level of expenses related to our existing drugs and drug candidates or pre clinical clinical development and commercialization programs any intellectual property infringement actions in which we may become involved announcements concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical industry in general fluctuations in product revenue sales and marketing expenses and profitability manufacture supply or distribution variations in our results of operations announcements about our results of operations that are not in line with analyst expectations the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on results of operations publication of operating or industry metrics by third parties including government statistical agencies that differ from expectations of industry or financial analysts changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts media reports whether or not true about our business our competitors or our industry additions to or departures of our management fluctuations of exchange rates between the rmb and the u s dollar release or expiry of lock up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ordinary shares or adss sales or perceived potential sales of additional ordinary shares or adss by us our executive officers and directors or our shareholders general economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the u s equity markets changes in accounting principles and changes or developments in the prc or global regulatory environment in addition the stock market in general and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our adss regardless of our actual operating performance further the current volatility in the financial markets and related factors beyond our control may cause the market price of our adss to decline rapidly and unexpectedly after the completion of this offering we may face an increased risk of securities class action litigation historically securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a significant decline in the market price of its securities this risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant share price volatilities in recent years if we were to face lawsuits it could lead to substantial costs and a distraction of management 146 s attention and resources which could harm our business if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our adss the market price for our adss and trading volume could decline the trading market for our adss will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if research analysts do not establish and maintain adequate research coverage or if table of contents one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our adss or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the market price for our adss would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our adss to decline because our initial public offering price is substantially higher than our net tangible book value per share you will experience immediate and substantial dilution if you purchase adss in this offering you will pay more for your adss than the amount paid by our existing shareholders for their ordinary shares on a per ads basis as a result you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of us 8 94 per ads assuming that no outstanding options to acquire ordinary shares are exercised representing the difference between i the initial public offering price of us 14 00 per ads and ii our pro forma net tangible book value adjusted per ads as of september 30 2019 after giving effect to our sale of the adss offered in this offering in addition you may experience further dilution to the extent that our ordinary shares are issued upon the exercise of share options see 147 dilution 148 for a more complete description of how the value of your investment in the adss will be diluted upon completion of this offering because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future after this offering you must rely on price appreciation of our adss for return on your investment we currently intend to retain most if not all of our available funds and any future earnings after this offering to fund the development and growth of our business as a result we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future therefore you should not rely on an investment in our adss as a source for any future dividend income our board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends subject to certain requirements of cayman islands law in addition our shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare a dividend but no dividend may exceed the amount recommended by our directors under cayman islands law a cayman islands company may pay a dividend out of either profit or share premium account of the company provided that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid out of share premium if this would result in the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business even if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends the timing amount and form of future dividends if any will depend on our future results of operations and cash flow our capital requirements and surplus the amount of distributions if any received by us from our subsidiaries our financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors accordingly the return on your investment in our adss will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our adss there is no guarantee that our adss will appreciate in value after this offering or even maintain the price at which you purchased the adss you may not realize a return on your investment in our adss and you may even lose your entire investment in our adss substantial future sales or perceived potential sales of our adss in the public market could cause the price of our adss to decline sales of our adss in the public market after this offering or the perception that these sales could occur could cause the market price of our adss to decline upon completion of this offering we will have 131 239 439 ordinary shares issued and outstanding including 17 037 020 ordinary shares represented by adss assuming the underwriters do not exercise their over allotment option all adss sold in this offering will be freely transferable without restriction or additional registration under the united states securities act of 1933 as amended or the securities act the remaining ordinary shares issued and outstanding after this offering will be available for sale upon the expiration of the 180 day lock up period beginning from the date of this prospectus subject to volume and other restrictions as applicable under rules 144 and 701 under the securities act any or all of these shares may be released prior to the expiration of the lock up period at the discretion of the representatives of the underwriters of this offering to the extent shares are released before the expiration of the lock up period and sold into the market the market price of our adss could decline after completion of this offering certain holders of our ordinary shares may cause us to register under the securities act the sale of their shares subject to the 180 day lock up period in connection with this offering registration of these shares under the securities act would result in adss representing these shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration sales of these registered shares in the form of adss in the public market could cause the price of our adss to decline table of contents the voting rights of holders of adss are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement and you may not be able to exercise the same rights as our shareholders holders of adss do not have the same rights as our shareholders as a holder of our adss you will not have any direct right to attend general meetings of our shareholders or to cast any votes at such meetings as

of the deposit agreement under the deposit agreement you may vote only by giving voting instructions to the depositary upon receipt of your voting instructions the depositary will try as far as is practicable to vote the ordinary shares underlying your adss in accordance with your instructions if we ask for your instructions then upon receipt of your voting instructions the depositary will try to vote the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with these instructions if we do not instruct the depositary to ask for your instructions the depositary may still vote in accordance with instructions you give but it is not required to do so you will not be able to directly exercise your right to vote with respect to the underlying ordinary shares unless you withdraw the shares and become the registered holder of such shares prior to the record date for the general meeting when a general meeting is convened you may not receive sufficient advance notice of the meeting to withdraw the shares underlying your adss and become the registered holder of such shares to allow you to attend the general meeting and to vote directly with respect to any specific matter or resolution to be considered and voted upon at the general meeting in addition under our post offering memorandum and articles of association that will become effective prior to completion of this offering for the purposes of determining those shareholders who are entitled to attend and vote at any general meeting our directors may close our register of members and or fix in advance a record date for such meeting and such closure of our register of members or the setting of such a record date may prevent you from withdrawing the ordinary shares underlying your adss and becoming the registered holder of such shares prior to the record date so that you would not be able to attend the general meeting or to vote directly if we ask for your instructions the depositary will notify you of the upcoming vote and will arrange to deliver our voting materials to you we have agreed to give the depositary notice of shareholder meetings sufficiently in advance of such meetings nevertheless we cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote the underlying ordinary shares represented by your adss in addition the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for their manner of carrying out your voting instructions this means that you may not be able to exercise your right to direct how the shares underlying your adss are voted and you may have no legal remedy if the shares underlying your adss are not voted as you requested in addition in your capacity as an ads holder you will not be able to call a shareholders 146 meeting except in limited circumstances the depositary for our adss will give us a discretionary proxy to vote the ordinary shares underlying your adss if you do not vote at shareholders 146 meetings which could adversely affect your interests under the deposit agreement for the adss if you do not vote the depositary will give us a discretionary proxy to vote the ordinary shares underlying your adss at shareholders 146 meetings unless we have instructed the depositary that we do not wish a discretionary proxy to be given we have informed the depositary that there is substantial opposition as to a matter to be voted on at the meeting a matter to be voted on at the meeting would have an adverse impact on shareholders or the voting at the meeting is to be made on a show of hands the effect of this discretionary proxy is that you cannot prevent our ordinary shares underlying your adss from being voted except under the circumstances

the securities act accordingly you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings you may not receive cash dividends if the depositary decides it is impractical to make them available to you the depositary will pay cash dividends on the adss only to the extent that we decide to distribute dividends on our ordinary shares or other deposited

agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on our ordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses pursuant to the deposit agreement you will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your adss represent however the depositary may at its discretion decide that it is inequitable or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of adss for example the depositary may determine that it is not practicable to distribute certain property through the mail or that the value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of mailing them in these cases the depositary may decide not to distribute such property to you you may be subject to limitations on transfer of your adss your adss are transferable on the books of the depositary however the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with

to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or under any provision of the deposit agreement or for any other reason certain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable we are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands we conduct our operations in china and substantially all of our assets are located in china in addition our directors and executive officers and some of the experts named in this prospectus reside within china and most of the assets of these persons are located within china as a result it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the united states in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the u s federal securities laws or otherwise even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind the laws of the cayman islands and of the prc may render you unable to enforce a

any claim they may have against us or the depositary arising out of or relating to our shares the adss or the deposit agreement including any claim under the u s federal securities laws also we may amend or terminate the deposit agreement without your consent if you continue to hold your adss after an amendment to the deposit agreement you agree to be bound by the deposit agreement as amended if we or the depositary were to oppose a jury trial demand based on such waiver the court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable in the facts and circumstances of that case in accordance with applicable state and federal law including whether a party knowingly intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to a jury trial the waiver to right to a jury trial of the deposit agreement is not intended to be deemed a waiver by any holder or beneficial owner of adss of our or the depositary 146 s compliance with the u s federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder table of contents if you or any other holders or beneficial owners of adss bring a claim against us or the depositary in connection with matters arising under the deposit agreement or the adss including claims under u s federal securities laws you or such other holder or beneficial owner may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to such claims which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits against us and or the depositary if a lawsuit is brought against us and or the depositary under the deposit agreement it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable trial court in which the trial would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would have had including results that could be less favorable to the plaintiff s in any such action nevertheless if this jury trial waiver provision is not enforced to the extent a court action proceeds it would proceed under the terms of the deposit agreement with a jury trial no condition stipulation or provision of the deposit agreement or adss serves as a waiver by any holder or beneficial owner of adss or by us or the depositary of compliance with any substantive provision of the u s federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder you may face difficulties in protecting your interests and your ability to protect your rights through u s courts may be limited because we are incorporated under cayman islands law we are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands with limited liability our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association the companies law 2018 revision of the cayman islands which we refer to as the companies law and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of shareholders to take action against our directors actions by our minority shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors to us under cayman islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the cayman islands the common law of the cayman islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the cayman islands as well as from the common law of england the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority but are not binding on a court in the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the united states in particular the cayman islands has a less developed body of securities laws than the united states some u s states such as delaware have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the cayman islands in addition cayman islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the united states shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies our directors have discretion under our post offering articles of association that will become effective immediately prior to completion of this offering to determine whether or not and under what conditions our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest as a result of all of the above our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the united states for a discussion of significant differences between the provisions of the companies law and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the united states and their shareholders see 147 description of share capital 151 differences in corporate law 148 we have not determined a specific use for a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and we may use these proceeds in ways with which you may not agree we have not determined a specific use for a portion of the net proceeds of this offering and our management will have considerable discretion in deciding how to apply these proceeds you will not have the opportunity to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately before you make your investment decision you must rely on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering we cannot assure you that the net proceeds will be used in a manner that would improve our results of operations or increase our ads price nor that these net proceeds will be placed only in investments that generate income or appreciate in value table of contents the post offering memorandum and articles of association that will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering will contain anti takeover provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us and adversely affect the rights of holders of our ordinary shares and the adss we have adopted an amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering which we refer to as the post offering memorandum and articles of association our post offering memorandum and articles of association will contain provisions to limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change of control transactions these provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations powers preferences privileges and relative participating optional or special rights and the qualifications limitations or restrictions including dividend rights conversion rights voting rights terms of redemption and liquidation preferences any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our ordinary shares in the form of ads or otherwise preferred shares could be issued with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult if our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares the price of our adss may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and adss may be materially and adversely affected we are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the securities act and may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements we are an 147 emerging growth company 148 as defined in the u s jumpstart our business startups act of 2012 or the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including most significantly not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of sarbanes oxley act of 2002 for so long as we are an emerging growth company as a result if we elect not to comply with such auditor attestation requirements our investors may not have access to certain information they may deem important the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until such date that a private company is otherwise required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards however we have elected to 147 opt out 148 of this provision and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted for public companies this decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the jobs act is irrevocable we are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the exchange act and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to u s domestic public companies because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the exchange act we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the united states that are applicable to u s domestic issuers including the rules under the exchange act requiring the filing with the sec of quarterly reports on form 10 q or current reports on form 8 k the sections of the exchange act regulating the solicitation of proxies consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the exchange act the sections of the exchange act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time and the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under regulation fd promulgated by sec we will be required to file an annual report on form 20 f within four months of the end of each fiscal year in addition we intend to publish our results on a quarterly basis as press releases distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the nasdaq stock market press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the sec on form 6 k however the information we are required to file with or furnish to the sec will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the sec by u s domestic issuers as a result you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a u s domestic issuer table of contents as an exempted company incorporated in the cayman islands we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from the nasdaq stock market 146 s corporate governance requirements these practices may afford less protection to shareholders than they would enjoy if we complied fully with the nasdaq stock market 146 s corporate governance requirements as a cayman islands company listed on the nasdaq stock market we are subject to the nasdaq stock market 146 s corporate governance requirements however the nasdaq stock market rules permit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of its home country certain corporate governance practices in the cayman islands which is our home country may differ significantly from the nasdaq stock market 146 s corporate governance requirements for example neither the companies law nor our post offering memorandum and articles of association that will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering requires a majority of our directors to be independent and we could include non independent directors as members of our compensation committee and nominating committee and our independent directors would not necessarily hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present currently we do not plan to rely on home country practice with respect to our corporate governance after we complete this offering however if we choose to follow home country practice in the future our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under the nasdaq stock market 146 s corporate governance requirements applicable to u s domestic issuers there can be no assurance that we will not be classified as a passive foreign investment company or pfic for u s federal income tax purposes for any taxable year which could subject u s investors in our adss or ordinary shares to significant adverse u s income tax consequences we will be a passive foreign investment company or pfic for any taxable year if either i 75 or more of our gross income for such year consists of certain types of 147 passive 148 income or ii 50 or more of the average quarterly value of our assets as determined on the basis of fair market value during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income the 147 asset test 148 no assurance can be given with respect to our pfic status for the current taxable year or any future taxable year the determination of whether we are or will become a pfic is uncertain because it is a fact intensive inquiry made on an annual basis that will depend in part on the composition of our income and assets fluctuations in the market price of our adss may cause us to be a pfic for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market price of our adss from time to time which may be volatile for biopharmaceutical companies such as ours that have not yet achieved commercialization with respect to any of their products the composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how and how quickly we use our liquid assets and the cash raised in this offering under circumstances where our revenue from activities that produce passive income increases relative to our revenue from activities that produce non passive income or where we determine not to deploy cash for active purposes our risk of being a pfic will substantially increase because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules it is possible that the irs may challenge our classification or valuation of certain income and assets each of which may result in our being or becoming a pfic for the current or subsequent taxable years if we are a pfic in any taxable year a u s holder as defined in 147 taxation 151 united states federal income tax considerations 148 may incur significantly increased u s income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the adss or ordinary shares and on the receipt of distributions on the adss or ordinary shares to the extent such gain or distribution is treated as an 147 excess distribution 148 under the u s federal income tax rules and such holder may be subject to burdensome reporting requirements further if we are a pfic for any year during which a u s holder holds our adss or ordinary shares we generally will continue to be treated as a pfic for all succeeding years during which such u s holder holds our adss or ordinary shares for more information see 147 taxation 151 united states federal income tax considerations 151 passive foreign investment company considerations 148 we will incur increased costs and become subject to additional rules and regulations as a result of being a public company particularly after we cease to qualify as an 147 emerging growth company 148 as a public company we expect to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq global market impose various requirements on the corporate governance practices of public companies as a company with less than us 1 07 billion in net revenues for our last fiscal year we qualify as an 147 emerging growth company 148 pursuant to the jobs act an emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies these provisions table of contents include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 in the assessment of the emerging growth company 146 s internal control over financial reporting and permission to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies however we have elected to 147 opt out 148 of the provision that allows us to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted for public companies this decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the jobs act is irrevocable we expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some corporate activities more time consuming and costly after we are no longer an 147 emerging growth company 148 we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and the other rules and regulations of the sec we also expect that operating as a public company will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage in addition we will incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements it may also be more difficult for us to find qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules and regulations and we cannot predict or estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs in the past shareholders of a public company often brought securities class action suits against the company following periods of instability in the market price of that company 146 s securities if we were involved in a class action suit it could divert a significant amount of our management 146 s attention and other resources from our business and operations which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit any such class action suit whether or not successful could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future in addition if a claim is successfully made against us we may be required to pay significant damages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations table of contents special note regarding forward looking statements this prospectus contains forward looking

table of contents if you invest in our adss your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per ads and our net tangible book value per ads

existing shareholders for our presently outstanding ordinary shares and holders of our vested restricted shares and convertible preferred shares which will automatically convert into our ordinary shares upon the completion of this offering our net tangible book value as of september 30 2019 was approximately us 136 42 million net tangible book value represents the amount of our total consolidated tangible assets less the amount of our total consolidated liabilities dilution is determined by subtracting net tangible book value per ordinary share after giving effect to i the

to new investors table of contents enforceability of civil liabilities we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands as an exempted company with limited liability we are incorporated in the cayman islands because of certain benefits associated with being a cayman islands exempted company such as political and economic stability an effective judicial system a favorable tax system the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services however the cayman islands has a less developed body of securities laws than the united states and provides less protection for investors in addition cayman islands companies do not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states most of our assets are located outside the united states in addition most of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the united states and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon us or these persons or to enforce judgments obtained in u s courts against us or them including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states it may also be difficult for you to enforce judgments obtained in u s courts based on the civil liability provisions of the u s federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors we have appointed cogency global inc as our agent to receive service of process with respect to any action brought against us in the u s district court for the southern district of new york in connection with this offering under the federal securities laws of the united states or the securities laws of any state in the united states or any action brought against us in the supreme court of the state of new york in the county of new york in connection with this offering under the securities laws of the state of new york conyers dill amp pearman our counsel as to cayman islands law has advised us that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands would 1 recognize or enforce judgments of u s courts obtained against us or our directors or officers that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or the securities laws of any state in the united states or 2 entertain original actions brought in the cayman islands against us or our directors or officers that are predicated upon the federal securities laws of the united states or the securities laws of any state in the united states conyers dill amp pearman has informed us that the uncertainty with regard to cayman islands law relates to whether a judgment obtained from the u s courts under civil liability provisions of the securities law will be determined by the courts of the cayman islands as penal or punitive in nature the courts of the cayman islands may not recognize or enforce such judgments against a cayman company and because such a determination has not yet been made by a court of the cayman islands it is uncertain whether such civil liability judgments from u s courts would be enforceable in the cayman islands conyers dill amp pearman has further advised us that the courts of the cayman islands would recognize as a valid judgment a final and conclusive judgment in personam obtained in the federal or state courts of the united states under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum of money payable in respect of multiple damages taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or in certain circumstances an in personam judgment for non monetary relief and would give a judgment based thereon provided that a such courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment b such courts did not contravene the rules of natural justice of the cayman islands c such judgment was not obtained by fraud d the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands e no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of the cayman islands and f there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of the cayman islands junhe llp our counsel as to prc law has advised us that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of china would 1 recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states or 2 entertain original actions brought in each respective jurisdiction against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states junhe llp has further advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the prc civil procedures law the prc courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the table of contents requirements of the prc civil procedures law based either on treaties between china and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions china does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocal arrangements with the united states or the cayman islands that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in addition according to the prc civil procedures law courts in china will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of prc law or national sovereignty security or public interest as a result it is uncertain whether and on what basis a prc court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the united states or in the cayman islands under the prc civil procedures law foreign shareholders may initiate actions based on prc law before a prc court against a company for disputes if the plaintiff can establish a sufficient contact with china for a prc court to exercise jurisdiction and has a direct interest cause of action and a concrete claim the action may be initiated by a shareholder through filing a complaint with the prc court the prc court will determine whether to accept the complaint in accordance with the prc civil procedures law the shareholder may participate in the action by itself or entrust any other person or prc legal counsel to participate on behalf of such shareholder in addition it will be difficult for u s shareholders to originate actions against us in china in accordance with prc laws because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands and it will be difficult for u s shareholders by virtue only of holding our adss or ordinary shares to establish a connection to china for a prc court to have jurisdiction as required under the prc civil procedures law table of contents corporate

we acquired a controlling interest in i mab tianjin on july 15 2017 and have consolidated the results of operations of i mab tianjin and its subsidiaries since july 15 2017 in this section when discussing historical facts and operating results for the period before july 15 2017 147 we 148 147 us 148 147 our company 148 and 147 our 148 refer to i mab and its then subsidiaries and do not include i mab tianjin or its subsidiaries overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery development and commercialization of novel or highly differentiated biologics to treat diseases with significant unmet medical needs particularly cancers and autoimmune disorders we were founded to capture the opportunities presented by the confluence of two major developments 151 the emergence of an attractive and growing biologics market in china and the revolutionary scientific breakthroughs in cancer and autoimmune disease medicines we believe we are well positioned to become a biotech leader in china because of our innovative discovery expertise fit for purpose technology platforms biomarker enabled translational medicine capabilities and clinical development capabilities these integrated capabilities are further enhanced by our deep understanding of china 146 s biologics regulatory framework and our direct access to extensive pre clinical and clinical trial resources in china to date we have developed an innovative pipeline of more than 10 clinical and pre clinical stage assets through our internal research and development efforts and in licensing arrangements with global pharmaceutical and biotech companies we are fully aware of the competitive and regulatory challenges we face as an innovative clinical stage biotech company based in china including need to raise significant capital significant competition from global and other china based biopharmaceutical companies less streamlined regulatory pathway compared to countries with long established regulatory systems and potential implementation challenges and uncertainties of the recent government reform of the drug approval system however with these challenges in mind we have been mitigating the risks through our internal r amp d system that integrates multi functional aspects of our drug development process to proactively deal with some of the regulatory challenges mentioned above furthermore through our beijing office which focuses on regulatory matters we have established an effective communication channel with the regulatory agencies to discuss and resolve various regulatory issues promptly and effectively we see vast opportunities for immuno oncology and autoimmune biologics therapies in china first both the incidence and mortality of cancers in china have been increasing in recent years and are outpacing those in the united states and the rest of the world second many innovative biologics approved to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases in the united states and europe are not yet available in china third the chinese government has implemented new policies and regulations to simplify the review and approval cycle of clinical trials and new drug applications to encourage biologics innovation fourth there has been a continuous and rapid increase in personal disposable income in china coupled with ongoing improvement in basic national health insurance coverage making innovative biologics more accessible to more chinese patients according to the frost amp sullivan report china 146 s biologics market is growing faster than the global biologics market and is expected to reach approximately rmb1 3 trillion us 181 9 billion by 2030 in terms of sales revenue we believe we are uniquely positioned as a china based global player to tap into these vast commercial opportunities this is best demonstrated by our short journey in becoming one of the top clinical stage immunology table of contents companies in china according to the frost amp sullivan report we are ranked as top clinical stage china based immunology companies as measured by the innovative quality and number of investigational drugs and drug candidates under clinical and pre clinical development in our pipeline amount of pre ipo financing raised in excess of us 400 million in three years pre ipo valuation and recognition and awards earned in the biotech industry for example in 2018 and 2019 we are the only china based biotech company recognized by genetic engineering amp biotechnology news gen as a top 10 immuno oncology start up in the world to date our research and development capabilities encompass discovery translational medicine biologics cmc development pre clinical development and clinical development with footprints in shanghai beijing and the united states we are now at a critical juncture to transition from a clinical stage biotech company into a fully integrated end to end global biopharmaceutical company in the next few years since the commencement of our operation in 2014 we have devoted most of our efforts and financial resources to organize and staff our operations business planning raise capital establish our intellectual property portfolio and conduct pre clinical and clinical trials of our drug candidates we had raised in excess of us 400 million in pre ipo financing in the past three years we have not generated any revenue from product sales and as a result we have never been profitable and have incurred net losses since the commencement of our operations in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 our net losses were rmb298 2 million rmb402 8 million us 56 4 million and rmb1 103 4 million us 154 4 million respectively we do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for and commercialize a drug candidate and we cannot assure you that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits key factors affecting our results of operations our results of operations financial condition and the year to year comparability of our financial results have been and are expected to continue to be principally affected by the below factors cost and expenses structure our results of operations are significantly affected by our cost structure which primarily consists of research and development expenses and administrative expenses research and development activities are central to our business model we believe our ability to successfully develop drug candidates will be the primary factor affecting our long term competitiveness as well as our future growth and development developing high quality drug candidates requires a significant investment of resources over a prolonged period of time and a core part of our strategy is to continue making sustained investments in this area since our inception we have focused our resources on our research and development activities including conducting pre clinical studies and clinical trials and activities related to regulatory filings for our drug candidates our research and development expenses primarily include the following costs related to development of our pipeline assets under all stages including discovery pre clinical testing or clinical patent license fees and other fees under the licensing collaboration and development agreements with respect to our in licensed drug candidates and employee salaries and related benefit costs including share based compensation expenses for research and development personnel at this time we are unable to predict when if ever we will be able to achieve profitability even if we achieve profitability in the future we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods thereafter this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such drug candidates including the uncertainty of successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials establishing an appropriate safety profile establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third party manufacturers receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities commercializing the drug candidates if and when approved whether alone or in collaboration with others table of contents obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates continued acceptable safety profiles of the products following approval and retention of key research and development personnel any change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs timing and viability associated with the development of that drug candidate we expect research and development costs to continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we expand our operations and our development programs progress including as we continue to support and advance the clinical trials of our drug candidates our administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related benefit costs other administrative expenses include professional fees for consulting and auditing as well as other direct and allocated expenses for rental expenses for our facilities travel costs and other supplies used in administrative activities we expect our administrative expenses to increase in the future to support our pipeline assets and research and development efforts and the commercialization of our drug candidates once approval is obtained we also anticipate that our administrative expenses will increase as we operate as a public company following the completion of this offering revenue from out licensing agreements we continue to seek out licensing opportunities for our de prioritized assets to streamline our pipeline in 2017 and 2018 and for the nine months ended september 30 2019 our revenue consisted primarily of payments from granting licenses to use and otherwise exploit certain of our intellectual properties linked to our de prioritized assets see 147 business 151 licensing and collaboration arrangements 148 for more information on the existing out licensing arrangements in addition after validating clinical safety and preliminary efficacy of a drug candidate in our global portfolio in clinical trials in the united states we may elect to out license the global rights excluding greater china of such drug candidate while retaining the greater china rights for further development and commercialization but we may also choose to retain these rights for the united states or other countries or regions as we may deem fit before the commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be generated from out licensing our intellectual properties funding for our operations during the periods presented we funded our operations primarily from financing through the issuance and sale of preferred shares and convertible promissory notes in private placement transactions going forward in the event of successful commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates we expect to fund our operations in part with revenue generated from sales of our commercialized drug products however with the continuing expansion of our business and our product pipeline we may require further funding through public or private offerings debt financing collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources any fluctuation in our ability to fund our operations will impact our cash flow plan and our results of operations our ability to commercialize our drug candidates our business and results of operations depend on our ability to commercialize our drug candidates once and if those candidates are approved for marketing by the respective health authority currently our pipeline consists of more than ten drug candidates ranging in development status from pre clinical to late stage clinical programs although we currently do not have any product approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales we expect to generate revenue from sales of a drug candidate after we complete the clinical development obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize such drug candidate our late stage investigational drugs at or potentially near pivotal trials are tj202 tj101 tj301 and enoblituzumab see 147 business 151 our drug pipeline 148 for more information on the development status of our various drug candidates the effect of our acquisition of i mab tianjin we acquired a controlling interest in i mab tianjin on july 15 2017 and the remaining interest in i mab tianjin in may 2018 since our acquisition of the controlling interest in i mab tianjin on july 15 2017 i mab tianjin has been consolidated into our results of operations shortly after we acquired the controlling interest in i mab tianjin we integrated the operations of i mab tianjin into our operations i mab tianjin did not generate any external revenue from july 15 2017 to september 30 2019 in connection with our acquisition of i mab tianjin we identified rmb148 8 million of intangible assets and rmb162 6 million of table of contents goodwill of i mab tianjin goodwill is not amortized but impairment of goodwill assessment is performed on an least an annual basis on december 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable no impairment was identified as of december 31 2017 and 2018 and september 30 2019 impairment charges could substantially affect our results of operations in the periods of such charges in addition impairment charges would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future see 147 risk factors 151 risks related to our industry business and operations 151 change in business prospects of acquisitions may result in impairment to our goodwill which could negatively affect our reported results of operations 148 key components of results of operations revenues to date we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future before the successful commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates we generated substantially all of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 from granting licenses to use and otherwise exploit certain of our intellectual properties in connection with our de prioritized assets research and development expenses research and development expenses primarily consist of i payroll and other related expenses of research and development personnel ii fees associated with the exclusive development rights of our in licensed drug candidates iii fees for services provided by contract research organizations investigators and clinical trial sites that conduct our clinical studies and iv expenses relating to the development of our drug candidates including raw materials and supplies

periods we incurred research and development expenses of rmb578 4 million us 80 9 million for the nine months ended september 30 2019 we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our operations and to advance our pipeline and our drug candidates toward later stages table of contents administrative expenses

restricted cash cash cash equivalents and restricted cash beginning of the year period cash cash equivalents and restricted cash end of the year period we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one of our current or future drug candidates we anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the

the completion of this offering we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company in addition subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales marketing and manufacturing accordingly we anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations based on our current operating plan we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months in that time we expect that our expenses will increase substantially as we fund new and ongoing research and development activities and working capital needs we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates after this offering we may decide to enhance our liquidity position or increase our cash reserve for future operations and investments through additional financing the issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders and ads holders and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as an ads holder the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations which could potentially dilute your interest if we raise additional funds through collaborations strategic alliances or licensing table of contents arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us if we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed we may be required to delay limit reduce or terminate our product development or future

direct investment in prc entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of this offering to make loans to our prc subsidiaries in china which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business 148 and 147 use of proceeds 148 for more information on the related prc rules and regulations on the use of proceeds we expect that the majority of our future revenues will be denominated in rmb under existing prc foreign exchange regulations payments of current

limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified the following material weaknesses and other control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in the standards established by the u s public company accounting oversight board a 147 material weakness 148 is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company 146 s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weaknesses that have been identified relate to i our lack of sufficient and competent financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of u s gaap and sec reporting and compliance requirements to formalize key controls over financial reporting and to prepare consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and ii our lack of sufficient documented financial closing policies and procedures specifically those related to a accounting for licensing and collaboration agreements and b period end expenses cut off and accruals these material weaknesses if not timely remedied may lead to significant misstatements in our consolidated financial statements in the future we have implemented and plan to implement a number of measures to address the material weaknesses that have been identified in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 and the review of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended september 30 2019 we have hired additional qualified financial and accounting staff with working experience of u s gaap and sec reporting requirements and plan to continue such hiring efforts we intend to conduct regular and continuous u s gaap accounting and financial reporting training programs for our financial reporting and accounting personnel we further intend to establish sufficient and formal financial closing policies and procedures specifically those related to accounting for licensing and collaboration arrangements and period end cut off and accruals we plan to as work in progress engage an external consulting firm to assist us to assess sarbanes oxley act compliance requirements and improve our

closing process we will continue to implement these and other measures to remediate our internal control deficiencies we may incur significant costs in the implementation of such measures however the implementation of these measures may not fully address the deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and we cannot assure you that all of these measures will be sufficient to remediate our material weakness in time or at all as a company with less than us 1 07 billion in revenue for our last fiscal year we qualify as an 147 emerging growth company 148 pursuant to the jobs act an emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies these provisions include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 in the assessment of the emerging growth company 146 s internal control over financial reporting inflation to date inflation in china has not materially affected our results of operations according to the national bureau of statistics of china the year over year percent changes in the consumer price index for january 2017 2018 and table of contents 2019 were increases of 2 5 1 5 and 1 7 respectively although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past we may be affected if china experiences higher rates of inflation in the future holding company structure we are a holding company with no material operations of its own we currently conduct our operations primarily through our prc subsidiaries as a result our ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our prc subsidiaries if our existing prc subsidiaries or any newly formed ones incur debt on their own behalf in the future the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us in addition our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of its retained earnings if any as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations under prc law each of our subsidiaries and their subsidiaries in china is required to set aside at least 10 of its after tax profits each year if any to fund certain statutory reserve funds until such reserve funds reach 50 of their registered capital in addition our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china may allocate a portion of their after tax profits based on prc accounting standards to enterprise expansion funds and staff bonus and welfare funds at their discretion and their subsidiaries may allocate a portion of their after tax profits based on prc accounting standards to a surplus fund at their discretion the statutory reserve funds and the discretionary funds are not distributable as cash dividends remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign owned company out of china is subject to examination by the banks designated by safe our prc subsidiaries have not paid dividends and will not be able to pay dividends until they generate accumulated profits and meet the requirements for statutory reserve funds quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest and credit risk we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of rmb412 7 million rmb1 680 9 million us 235 2 million and rmb1 281 1 million us 179 2 million as of december 31 2017 and 2018 and september 30 2019 respectively our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash which is mostly held in interest bearing bank deposits interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates and we have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest risk exposure our credit risk is primarily attributable to the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents represent the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk we mainly place or invest cash and cash equivalents with state owned or reputable financial institutions in the prc and reputable financial institutions outside of the prc we do not believe that our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity and we will continually monitor the credit worthiness of these financial institutions while we believe our cash and cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk future investments may be subject to adverse changes in market value foreign exchange risk most of our revenues and expenses are denominated in rmb our management considers that the business is not exposed to any significant foreign exchange risk and we have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk although our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited in general the value of your investment in our adss will be affected by the exchange rate between u s dollar and rmb because the value of our business is effectively denominated in rmb while our adss will be traded in u s dollars rmb is not freely convertible into foreign currencies for capital account transactions the value of rmb against the u s dollar and other currencies is affected by among other things changes in china 146 s political and economic conditions and china 146 s foreign exchange prices on july 21 2005 the prc government changed its policy of pegging the value of the rmb to the u s dollar following the removal of the u s dollar peg the rmb appreciated more than 20 against the u s dollar over the following three years between july 2008 and june 2010 this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the rmb and the u s dollar remained within a narrow band since june 2010 the prc government has allowed the rmb to appreciate slowly against the u s dollar again and it has appreciated more than 10 since june 2010 on august 11 2015 the people 146 s bank of china announced plans to improve the central parity rate of the rmb against the u s dollar by authorizing market makers to provide parity to the china foreign exchange trading center operated by the people 146 s bank of china with reference to the table of contents interbank foreign exchange market closing rate of the previous day the supply and demand for foreign currencies as well as changes in exchange rates of major international currencies effective from october 1 2016 the international monetary fund added rmb to its special drawing rights currency basket such change and additional future changes may increase volatility in the trading value of the rmb against foreign currencies the prc government may adopt further reforms of its exchange rate system including making the rmb freely convertible in the future accordingly it is difficult to predict how market forces or prc or u s government policy may impact the exchange rate between rmb and the u s dollar in the future to the extent that we need to convert u s dollars into rmb for our operations appreciation of rmb against the u s dollar would reduce the rmb amount we receive from the conversion conversely if we decide to convert rmb into u s dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or adss servicing our outstanding debt or for other business purposes appreciation of the u s dollar against the rmb would reduce the u s dollar amounts available to us as of september 30 2019 we had rmb denominated cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of rmb101 3 million us 14 2 million a 10 depreciation of rmb against u s dollar based on the foreign exchange rate on september 30 2019 would result in a decrease of us 1 4 million in cash and cash equivalents a 10 appreciation of rmb against u s dollar based on the foreign exchange rate on september 30 2019 would result in an increase of us 1 4 million in cash and cash equivalents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with u s gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u s gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities and other intangible assets as well as subsequent fair value measurements additionally estimates are used in determining items such as useful lives of property plant and equipment write down of inventories allowance for doubtful accounts share based compensation impairment of long lived assets impairment of other intangible asset and goodwill taxes on income tax valuation allowances and revenues from research and development projects actual results could differ from those estimates revenue recognition we adopted accounting standard codification 147 asc 148 606 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 147 asc 606 148 for all periods presented consistent with the criteria of topic 606 we recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services under asc 606 an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services to determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of asc 606 the entity performs the following five steps i identify the contract s with a customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price including variable consideration if any iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation we only apply the five step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer once a contract is determined to be within the scope of asc 606 at contract inception we review the contract to determine which performance obligations it must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct we recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each performance obligation when that performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied collaboration revenue at contract inception we analyze its collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of asc 808 collaborative arrangements 147 asc 808 148 to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating table of contents activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities for collaboration arrangements within the scope of asc 808 that contain multiple elements we first determine if the collaboration is deemed to be within the scope of asc 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor customer relationship and therefore within the scope of asc 606 for the collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to asc 808 an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently our collaborative arrangements may contain more than one unit of account or performance obligation including grants of licenses to intellectual property rights agreement to provide research and development services and other deliverables the collaborative arrangements do not include a right of return for any deliverable as part of the accounting for these arrangements we must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract in developing the stand alone selling price for a performance obligation we consider competitor pricing for a similar or identical product market awareness of and perception of the product expected product life and current market trends in general the consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when the respective obligation is satisfied either by delivering a good or providing a service limited to the consideration that is not constrained when the timing of the delivery of product is different from the timing of payments made by the customers we recognizes either a contract asset performance precedes the contractual due date or a contract liability customer payment precedes performance our contractual payment terms are typically due in no more than 30 days from invoicing in limited situations certain customer contractual payment terms require us to bill in arrears thus we satisfy some or all of our performance obligations before we are contractually entitled to bill the customer in these situations billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition which results in a contract asset for example certain of the contractual arrangements do not permit us to bill until the completion of the production of the samples in other limited situations certain customer contractual payment terms allow us to bill in advance thus we receive customer cash payment before satisfying some or all of its performance obligations in these situations billing occurs in advance of revenue recognition which results in contract liabilities licenses of intellectual property upfront non refundable payments for licensing our intellectual property are evaluated to determine if the license is distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement for licenses determined to be distinct we recognize revenues from non refundable up front fees allocated to the license at a point in time when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license research and development services the portion of the transaction price allocated to research and development services performance obligations is deferred and recognized as collaboration revenue over time as delivery or performance of such services occurs milestone payments at the inception of each arrangement that includes development commercialization and regulatory milestone payments we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and to the extent that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur in future periods estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method the transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand alone selling price basis for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied at the end of each subsequent reporting period we re evaluate the probability of achieving such development milestones and any related constraint and if necessary adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch up basis which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment royalties for arrangements that include sales based royalties including milestone payments based on the level of sales and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate we recognize revenue at the later of i when the related sales occur or ii when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied table of contents research and development expenses elements of research and development expenses primarily include 1 payroll and other related expenses of personnel engaged in research and development activities 2 in licensed patent rights fee of exclusive development rights of drugs granted to us 3 expenses related to pre clinical testing of our technologies under development and clinical trials such as payments to contract research organizations 147 cro 148 investigators and clinical trial sites that conduct our clinical studies 4 costs to develop the drug candidates including raw materials and supplies product testing depreciation and facility related expenses and 5 other research and development expenses research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development services and have no alternative future uses we have acquired rights to develop and commercialize drug candidates upfront payments that relate to the acquisition of a new drug compound as well as pre commercial milestone payments are immediately expensed as acquired in process research and development in the period in which they are incurred provided that the new drug compound did not also include processes or activities that would constitute a 147 business 148 as defined under u s gaap the drug has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and absent obtaining such approval has no established alternative future use milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval would be capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the related product the conditions enabling capitalization of development expenses as an asset have not yet been met and therefore all development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss when incurred share based compensation we grant restricted shares and stock options to eligible employees and account for share based compensation in accordance with asc 718 compensation 151 stock compensation employees 146 share based compensation awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the awards and recognized as expenses i immediately at the grant date if no vesting conditions are required ii for share based awards granted with only service conditions using the graded vesting method net of estimated forfeitures over the vesting period or iii for share based awards granted with service conditions and the occurrence of an initial public offering as performance condition cumulative share based compensation expenses for the options that have satisfied the service condition should be recorded upon the completion of the initial public offering using the graded vesting method a change in any of the terms or conditions of share based awards is accounted for as a modification of the awards we calculate incremental compensation expense of a modification as the excess of the fair value of the modified awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before its terms are modified at the modification date for vested awards we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period when the modification occurs for awards not being fully vested we recognize the sum of the incremental compensation expense and the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for the original awards over the remaining requisite service period after modification share based compensation in relation to the restricted shares is measured based on the fair market value of our ordinary shares at the grant date of the award prior to the listing estimation of the fair value of our ordinary shares involves significant assumptions that might not be observable in the market and a number of complex and subjective variables including discount rate and subjective judgments regarding our projected financial and operating results its unique business risks the liquidity of its ordinary shares and its operating history and prospects at the time the grants are made share based compensation in relation to the share options is estimated using the binominal option pricing model the determination of the fair value of share options is affected by the share price of our ordinary shares as well as the assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including the expected share price

resulting from it fair value of ordinary shares 151 we are required to estimate the fair value of the ordinary shares on grant dates of share based compensation awards share option to our employees and the issuance of financial instruments to investors therefore our board of table of contents directors has estimated the fair value of our ordinary shares on various dates with inputs from management considering the third party valuations the valuations of our ordinary shares were performed using methodologies approaches and assumptions consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants audit and accounting practice aid series valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation or the aicpa practice guide in addition our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors along with inputs from management and the independent third party valuation firm to determine the fair value of our ordinary shares including external market conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry trends within the biopharmaceutical industry the prices at which we sold convertible preferred shares the superior rights and preference of the convertible preferred shares or other senior securities relative to our ordinary shares at the time of each grant and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering the option pricing method was used to allocate the enterprise 146 s value to preferred shares or other senior securities and ordinary shares taking into account the guidance prescribed by the aicpa practice guide this method treats ordinary shares and convertible preferred shares or other senior securities as call options on the enterprise 146 s value with exercise prices based on their respective payoffs upon a liquidity event in determining the enterprise 146 s value we applied the market approach backsolve method based on pricing from recent transactions in our own securities the basis for application of this method is our transactions in equity securities with unrelated parties or among unrelated parties themselves no evidence is observed to indicate these transactions are not arm 146 s length transactions our board of directors determined the fair value of our share options and the restricted shares as of the dates of grant taking into consideration the various objective and subjective factors described above including the conclusion of valuation of our ordinary shares as of dates close to the grant dates of our share options and the restricted shares we computed the per share estimated fair value for share options based on the binomial option pricing model and the per share estimated fair value for restricted shares based on per share estimated fair value of ordinary shares as of the date of grant once public trading market of the adss has been established in connection with the completion of this offering it will no longer be necessary for our board of directors to estimate the fair value of our ordinary shares in connection with our accounting for granted share options and restricted shares fair value measurements 151 our financial assets and liabilities primarily comprise of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash other financial assets contract assets other receivables short term borrowings accruals and other payables and warrant liabilities as of december 31 2017 and 2018 and september 30 2019 except for other financial assets and warrants liabilities the carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximated their fair values because of their generally short maturities we report other financial assets and warrant liabilities at fair value at each balance sheet date and changes in fair value are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss we measure our financial assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy the three levels are as follows level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the management has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset i e interest rates yield curves etc and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs level 3 includes unobservable inputs that reflect the management 146 s assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset the management develops these inputs based on the best information available including the own data table of contents we measured our short term investments at fair value on a recurring basis as our other financial assets and derivative liabilities are not traded in an active market with readily observable prices we use significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of other financial assets and derivatives liabilities these instruments are categorized in the level 3 valuation hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement recent accounting pronouncements a list of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are relevant to us is included in note 2 147 principal accounting policies 151 2 24 recent accounting pronouncements 148 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus table of contents we see vast commercial opportunities for immuno oncology and autoimmune biologics therapies in 2018 approximately 60 8 of the antibody based biologics in terms of global sales revenue targeted conditions in these areas according to the frost amp sullivan report in china the need for efficacious drugs to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases is rising due to limited availability of such medicines and delayed access to global innovative medicines the figure below illustrates the historical and projected market sizes of immune oncology therapies and autoimmune disease treatment globally and in china the figure below illustrates the unmet medical need for autoimmune diseases globally and in china table of contents despite the recent success of checkpoint inhibitors such as pd 1 and pd l1 clinical efficacy of these drugs has not lived up to expectations the frost amp sullivan report estimates that more than 60 of cancer patients including those with melanoma renal cell cancer colorectal cancer non small cell lung cancer urothelial cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma do not respond to pd 1 pd l1 monotherapies even for the tumor type with a high tumor mutational burden i e the total number of mutations with coding region of a tumor cell genome the orr rarely exceeds 30 for pd 1 pd l1 therapies similar findings are observed using pd l1 as a biomarker in the treatment of nsclc with pembrolizumab the average orr is 41 for pd l1 positive tumor and 13 for pd l1 negative tumor the immuno oncology field has been diligently seeking a more efficacious therapy with treatment agent s that works synergistically with pd 1 pd l1 therapies such a novel combination therapy may provide an effective treatment option for those who do not respond to current pd 1 pd l1 therapies for example our investigational drugs including tj107 enoblituzumab tjc4 and tjd5 are intended to work as combination therapies with pd 1 pd l1 regimens to address unmet medical needs in oncology currently our target indications in the area of immuno oncology cover a variety of hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma lymphoma and solid tumors such as head and neck cancer and cancer treatment related lymphopenia for autoimmune diseases our target indications include systemic lupus erythematosus ulcerative colitis rheumatoid arthritis and other il 6 implicated autoimmune diseases the discussion below provides i an overview of the market trends and growth drivers in china 146 s biologics market and ii an overview of the competitive landscape and key segments with respect to our most advanced clinical stage product candidates trends and growth drivers of biologics market in china according to the frost amp sullivan report the growth of china 146 s biologics market is attributable in particular to large and growing oncology and autoimmune disease patient populations 151 china 146 s oncology patient population especially treatment naive patients has been increasing over the years new cases of cancers in china reached 4 3 million in 2018 and are projected to reach 4 9 million in 2023 china also has a large autoimmune disease population in 2018 systemic lupus erythematosus ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis affected approximately 1 0 million 0 4 million and 5 9 million patients in china respectively unmet demands for innovative biologics therapies targeting oncology 151 many biologics especially monoclonal antibodies have proved to have superior efficacy and less side effects for treating cancer however many antibody drugs approved to treat cancer in the united states are not available in china from 1997 to 2018 37 therapeutic antibodies were launched globally but only seven of them are marketed in china unmet demands for effective therapies targeting autoimmune diseases 151 to date there are no curative therapies for many autoimmune diseases targeted biologics that aim to improve physical functioning and prevent irreversible tissue or organ damage offer a promising trajectory this class of biologics is expected to stimulate the biologics market that targets autoimmune diseases in china the sales revenue of this market was rmb2 5 billion in 2018 and is projected to increase to rmb87 8 billion in 2030 representing a compound annual growth rate 147 cagr 148 of 34 6 increasing cost burden of autoimmune diseases 151 autoimmune diseases have been reported to be on the rise in china making this poorly understood category of diseases a public health issue at levels comparable table of contents to heart disease and cancer because of a lack of effective treatment and awareness amongst the general public and medical practitioners the associated cost of autoimmune diseases accounts for a significant portion of the rising cost of healthcare burden in china innovative biologic treatments as a means of reducing healthcare spending while ensuring improved public health can help address the mounting pressure surrounding autoimmune increasing investment in biologics 151 research and development in innovative biologics therapies is the key to industry growth discovery and development of new biologics is a long difficult and expensive process research and development investment for biologics in china is expected to continue rising in the future leading to more new products entering the market the continuous launch of new products will further drive the growth of china 146 s biologics industry favorable environment for clinical trials 151 with nearly a one fourth of the world 146 s cancer patient population china provides an excellent opportunity to access a large patient pool and clinical resources for oncology drug development and market demands the chinese government has taken initiatives to address regulatory challenges that previously caused a lag in clinical trial applications of therapeutic biologics notably in october 2017 the general office of the cpc central committee and the general office of the state council issued the opinions on deepening the reform of the evaluation and approval systems and encouraging innovation on drugs and medical devices which aims to improve the regulatory approval process and encourage technological innovation for new drugs in addition in july 2018 the nmpa implemented technical guidelines for accepting data from overseas clinical trials of drugs which significantly shortens the registration process and provides potential clinical trial exemptions for drugs that have robust clinical data from trials conducted overseas increasing affordability 151 the average disposable income of the chinese population is expected to continue growing rapidly increasing the willingness and ability of patients to pay for medications in 2019 households with an annual disposable income of over us 30 000 accounted for 38 1 of the total households in china and are expected to increase to 56 5 of the total households in china by 2023 as more chinese households increase their spending power they can afford more expensive medical treatments particularly for life threatening diseases in addition inclusion of a drug in the national reimbursement drug list 147 nrdl 148 typically results in a much higher sales volume and significant sales growth despite a reduction in price such inclusion is expected to be implemented for innovative biologics on a regular basis suggesting that more biologics are expected to be covered by the nrdl in the future further increasing the affordability of biologics in china as biologics become increasingly affordable to the general public they will be used more commonly as a treatment for oncology and autoimmune diseases as a result the market size of the biologics industry in china is expected to continue to grow multiple myeloma overview multiple myeloma 147 mm 148 is a type of blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by excessive proliferation of malignant plasma cells that accumulate in the bone marrow where they displace and suppress healthy blood progenitor cell populations cause destructive lytic bone lesions rounded punched out areas of the bone diffuse osteoporosis bone pain and produce abnormal proteins that accumulate in the urine and anemia in greater china new cases of mm reached approximately 20 500 in 2018 and is expected to increase to approximately 23 700 in 2023 representing a cagr of 2 9 according to the frost amp sullivan report mm is primarily a disease of the elderly and this population of patients 65 years and older continues to grow at a fast clip in china in fact the new incidence of mm in china is projected to reach approximately 28 300 in 2030 representing a cagr of 2 6 from 2023 to 2030 treatment of mm mm treatment is individualized but generally includes small molecules drugs and biologics the primary treatment regimens are cytoreductive chemotherapies in combination with stem cell transplants aimed at achieving a cure if possible in addition mm patients require substantial supportive therapy aimed at managing complications of the disease such as bone damage and ameliorating the side effects of treatment there are a number of drug classes for mm treatment including monoclonal antibodies immunomodulatory drugs proteasome table

genomic tests symptoms and disease complications prior myeloma treatment as well as the patient 146 s lifestyle goals views on quality of life and personal preferences in addition many cancer centers have developed their own guidelines for treating mm in china drugs approved for treating relapsed or refractory mm 147 rrmm 148 include daratumumab darzalex from janssen lenalidomide revlimid from celgene thalidomide thalomid from celgene bortezomib velcade from takeda and ixazomib ninlaro from takeda unmet medical need currently there is no curative treatment for rrmm although the currently marketed cd38 antibody product is efficacious it takes a long time to be administered by iv infusion up to six hours and causes a high infusion reaction rate 147 irr 148 in clinical trials approximately half of all patients experience an infusion reaction which may include fever chills nausea bronchospasm hypoxia dyspnea hypertension laryngeal edema and pulmonary edema thus there is a need for a safer and convenient to use drug such a drug may be combined with other therapeutic agents for better treatment effects in rrmm competitive landscape there are various monotherapy agents and combination treatments currently under clinical development targeting different lines of mm therapies our tj202 if approved is a potentially highly differentiated cd38 monoclonal antibody and

disease are typically treated with drug therapy the combination of surgery and drug therapy with or without radiation therapy is the current standard of care for stage 3 scchn patients with locally advanced disease platinum based chemotherapy regimens are widely used as first line therapies for stage 4 and distant relapse patients erbitux cetuximab from eli lilly and merck kgaa was approved in 2006 as a first line treatment of locally advanced scchn in combination with radiation therapy regimens containing erbitux platinum based chemotherapy and 5 fluorouracil known as extreme are often considered as the standard of care for first line treatment of distant relapse scchn second line therapy is highly varied including single agent docetaxel or paclitaxel erbitux monotherapy or erbitux paclitaxel combination therapy in 2016 pd 1 inhibitors were approved globally as a second line therapy and more recently keytruda pembrolizumab from merck amp co as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy was approved by the fda as a first line therapy for metastatic or unresectable recurrent scchn in october 2019 the nmpa approved a pd 1 inhibitor opdivo nivolumab from bristol myers squibb for use in patients with scchn that has progressed during chemotherapy with a platinum based drug or that has recurred or metastasized after platinum based chemotherapy unmet medical need according to datamonitor healthcare 146 s epidemiology forecast 2016 2036 76 of all actively treated patients with scchn have stage 3 stage 4 local relapse or distant relapse disease but efficacious treatment options are limited for these patients for example only about 35 of all patients with distant relapse scchn respond to extreme and the resulting overall median survival is only 10 1 months in addition about half of the patients on first line therapies need later line therapies in addition the average orr for second line pd 1 therapies has been less than 15 as such scchn patients especially those with late stage or relapsed disease need more efficacious treatments with fewer side effects which represents a significant unmet medical need competitive landscape our enoblituzumab

systemic lupus erythematosus 147 sle 148 is a chronic multi system and incurable autoimmune disease that can potentially lead to serious organ damage systemic complications and even death patients with sle have aberrant production of auto antibodies antibodies against self antigens by cd38 positive plasma cells and dysregulated cd38 positive pathogenic b cells as part of the disease mechanism immune complexes induced by auto antibodies are formed and deposit in the kidneys and cause tissue damage common symptoms of sle include painful and table of contents swollen joints unexplained fever chest pain hair loss mouth ulcers swollen lymph nodes extreme fatigue and red rashes that most commonly appear on the face and these symptoms vary widely among patients and fluctuate unpredictably over time as the disease progresses more importantly at the advanced stage of the disease patients can develop renal damage and renal failure according to the frost amp sullivan report sle had an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 04 million in 2018 in greater china which is projected to increase to 1 08 million in 2023 representing a cagr of 0 8 cases of sle in china are projected to increase to 1 11 million in 2030 treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus currently there is a significant unmet medical need for more effective therapies for sle since sle is a chronic disease current treatments aim to manage symptoms and reduce the frequency of disease flares patients with mild sle are often managed by non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs while more severe patients may need corticosteroids or immunosuppressants combination treatments can also be used as disease modifying treatment regimens aiming to control the disease and prevent chronic tissue damage approved by the fda in 2011 and by the nmpa in july 2019 benlysta belimumab a b lymphocyte stimulator blys specific inhibitor developed by gsk is currently the world 146 s only biologic approved to treat sle unmet medical need the effect of symptomatic treatments for sle including non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs is short lived and often very limited the therapeutic role of corticosteroids or immunosuppressants in the long term management of sle is hampered by severe drug related side effects and lack of a disease modifying effect as auto antibodies and resulting immune complexes produced by cd38 positive b cells and plasma cells act at the core of the pathogenesis of sle direct inhibition and selective depletion of pathogenic b cells and plasma cells are believed to offer better treatment options tj202 has the potential to offer such a disease modifying treatment option in addition the advantages of tj202 include convenience of use and a lower irr making it a more favorable

often used as an initial treatment and throughout the course of clinical management with limited treatment efficacy approved by the nmpa in 2019 infliximab remicade which is a tnf 097 inhibitor is currently the only biologic approved to treat uc in china unmet medical need the incidence of uc is increasing rapidly but uc patients especially those with a moderate to severe disease have few treatment options which have limited treatment efficacy and considerable side effects for example jak1 3 kinase inhibitors can carry the risk of serious infections and malignancies tnf 097 inhibitors also have inherent side effects and do not work in all patients according to the frost amp sullivan report approximately 45 patients are considered treatment non responders to tnf 097 drugs among all

disrupted since growth hormone plays a critical role in stimulating body growth and development and is involved in the production of muscle protein and the breakdown of fats deficiency in growth hormone affects numerous physiological processes resulting in short stature in children and other physical ailments in both children 147 pghd 148 and adults 147 aghd 148 according to the frost amp

therapy which is given in a calculated weight based dosing regimen currently short acting recombinant human growth hormone 147 rhgh 148 is commonly used for the long term treatment of children and adults with inadequate endogenous growth hormone secretion there are certain safety concerns related to long term use of pegylated drugs such as potential renal toxicity cellular vacuolation and formation of anti polyethylene glycol antibodies approved by the nmpa in 2014 jintrolong developed by genescience is currently the only long acting pegylated rhgh in china other companies in china currently developing long acting rhgh include anhui anke biotechnology xiamen amoytop biotech generon pharmaceutical technology and visen pharmaceuticals unmet medical need according to the frost amp sullivan report only 3 7 of all pghd patients in china were receiving growth hormone replacement therapy in 2018 which consists of daily injections of rhgh before sleep this dosing regimen puts a substantial burden on pediatric patients and their families because it requires drug preparation and needle injection every day which is painful and extremely inconvenient often resulting in poor patient compliance more importantly studies have shown that skipping just one or two doses in a week can significantly reduce the efficacy of the treatment therefore there is a substantial medical need for long acting growth hormone therapies that are similarly efficacious but with reduced injection frequency and the market potential for such a long acting rhgh in china is largely untapped in

therapeutics market size 2014 2030e table of contents overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery development and commercialization of novel or highly differentiated biologics to treat diseases with significant unmet medical needs particularly cancers and autoimmune disorders we were founded to capture the opportunities presented by the confluence of two major developments 151 the emergence of an attractive and growing biologics market in china and the revolutionary scientific breakthroughs in cancer and autoimmune disease medicines we believe we are well positioned to become a biotech leader in china because of our innovative discovery expertise fit for purpose technology platforms biomarker enabled translational medicine capabilities and clinical development capabilities these integrated capabilities are further enhanced by our deep understanding of china 146 s biologics regulatory framework and our direct access to extensive pre clinical and clinical trial resources in china to date we have developed an innovative pipeline of more than 10 clinical and pre clinical stage assets through our internal research and development efforts and in licensing arrangements with global pharmaceutical and biotech companies commercial opportunities in china and our unique position we are fully aware of the competitive and regulatory challenges we face as an innovative clinical stage biotech company based in china including need to raise significant capital significant competition from global and other china based biopharmaceutical companies less streamlined regulatory pathway compared to countries with long established regulatory systems and potential implementation challenges and uncertainties of the recent government reform of the drug approval system however with these challenges in mind we have been mitigating the risks through our internal r amp d system that integrates multi functional aspects of our drug development process to proactively deal with some of the regulatory challenges mentioned above furthermore through our beijing office which focuses on regulatory matters we have established an effective communication channel with the regulatory agencies to discuss and resolve various regulatory issues promptly and effectively we see vast opportunities for immuno oncology and autoimmune biologics therapies in china first both the incidence and mortality of cancers in china have been increasing in recent years and are outpacing those in the united states and the rest of the world second many innovative biologics approved to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases in the united states and europe are not yet available in china third the chinese government has implemented new policies and regulations to simplify the review and approval cycle of clinical trials and new drug applications to encourage biologics innovation fourth there has been a continuous and rapid increase in personal disposable income in china coupled with ongoing improvement in basic national health insurance coverage making innovative biologics more accessible to more chinese patients according to the frost amp sullivan report china 146 s biologics market is growing faster than the global biologics market and is expected to reach approximately rmb1 3 trillion us 181 9 billion by 2030 in terms of sales revenue we believe we are uniquely positioned as a china based global player to tap into these vast commercial opportunities this is best demonstrated by our short journey in becoming one of the top clinical stage immunology companies in china according to the frost amp sullivan report we are ranked as top clinical stage china based immunology companies as measured by the innovative quality and number of investigational drugs and drug candidates under clinical and pre clinical development in our pipeline amount of pre ipo financing raised in excess of us 400 million in three years pre ipo valuation and recognition and awards earned in the biotech industry for example in 2018 and 2019 we are the only china based biotech company recognized by genetic engineering amp biotechnology news gen as a top 10 immuno oncology start up in the world to date our research and development capabilities encompass discovery translational medicine biologics cmc development pre clinical development and clinical development with footprints in shanghai beijing and the united states we are now at a critical juncture to transition from a clinical stage biotech company into a fully integrated end to end global biopharmaceutical company in the next few years our unique business model to achieve our mission and capitalize on these commercial opportunities we have developed a business model built on two pillars a fast to market china strategy and a fast to poc proof of concept global strategy table of contents fast to market china strategy our fast to market china strategy focuses on seeking opportunities to in license the development and commercialization rights of investigational drugs from global biopharmaceutical companies for greater china we only select investigational drugs that have the potential to become novel or highly differentiated medicines through our substantial in house research and development efforts we build additional data packages to meet the requirements of the national medical products administration the 147 nmpa 148 to ensure programs are ready for late stage or registrational clinical development our internal development capabilities combined with our deep insight into china 146 s regulatory framework and our clinical network enable us to efficiently navigate through the drug development process to registration to date we have built an innovative china portfolio consisting of five investigational drugs with an aim for near term product launch all of these investigational drugs have met the related pre set safety and preliminary efficacy endpoints in phase 1 or phase 2 clinical trials in europe the united states or elsewhere and are either in or ready for phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials in china tj202 is undergoing two registrational trials including a third line monotherapy trial and a second line combination therapy trial in multiple myeloma in greater china in addition we submitted an ind application to the nmpa in october 2019 for a phase 1b trial for tj202 in systemic lupus erythematosus 147 sle 148 for tj101 we are working towards submitting an ind application in 2020 for a phase 3 registrational trial in china for enoblituzumab we expect to submit an ind application in 2020 for a registrational trial or a phase 2 trial as a result the investigational drugs in our china portfolio are positioned for a series of new drug applications ndas in china with the submission of the first nda expected in 2021 fast to poc global strategy our fast to poc global strategy focuses on advancing our own novel or differentiated biologics towards clinical validation in the united states first we seek poc of these drug candidates in the united states by conducting early phase clinical trials with a set of safety and efficacy endpoints and leveraging the fda 146 s streamlined regulatory system for innovative drug development including a predictable timeline towards ind approval second we will use the data generated to advance clinical development in china which we believe confers several advantages including access to china 146 s large patient pool extensive clinical trial resources through collaborations with leading hospitals in china and a regulatory pathway for fast track approval of drugs supported by solid overseas clinical data building on this approach we may out license the global rights excluding greater china of these investigational drugs following clinical validation in the united states while retaining the greater china rights for further development and commercialization we believe this approach will allow chinese patients to benefit from our most advanced treatments concurrently or soon after their market approvals elsewhere to date we have created a global portfolio that consists of two molecular classes 151 monoclonal antibodies and bi specific antibodies which are internally generated they are highly innovative molecules compared to global competitor assets in the same or related classes of drug candidates three investigational drugs in our global portfolio tjm2 tjc4 and tjd5 are in phase 1 trials in the united states having obtained ind approvals from the nmpa for tjc4 tjd5 and tjm2 we have initiated a phase 1 trial for tjc4 and expect to initiate phase 1 trials for tjd5 and tjm2 in china in early 2020 these two strategies and the resulting two portfolios complement each other this enables us to achieve a balance among our ambition to develop novel or highly differentiated drugs our goal to efficiently advance our pipeline assets towards commercialization and the inherent development risks with this goal in mind we are also aware that the intended novelty and key differentiation of our investigational drugs or drug candidates are subject to pivotal clinical validation and approval by the relevant regulatory authorities there is no assurance that any such investigational drug or drug candidate will receive regulatory approval see 147 risk factors 148 for a detailed description of the risks related to the development and commercialization of our drug candidates our capabilities our innovative discovery expertise built by an elite group of seasoned immunologists with extensive academic research and drug development experience our discovery engine has generated a panel of internally developed innovative drug molecules in a short span of four years among them 11 innovative drug molecules have met our standard of novelty or high differentiation and have advanced toward further development this achievement is a testament to our discovery team 146 s acumen and technical prowess in translating target biology into points of innovation or differentiation table of contents the discovery of tjc4 showcases our innovative research capabilities not settling on performing routine or traditional antibody screening we set a specific goal to identify and select a unique cd47 antibody that is free from binding to red blood cells rbc from all cd47 antibody leads as a result we selected by design our proprietary cd47 antibody tjc4 with a rare epitope that uniquely spares binding to rbcs as a differentiation point from other cd47 antibodies that typically cause inherent hematologic side effects having confirmed the rbc sparing property in a series of in vitro assays as well as multiple monkey studies we are conducting a phase 1 clinical trial for tjc4 in the united states another example of our r amp d capability relates to our novel bi specific antibody panel that represents a new wave of oncology drug candidates we created novel biological properties of these bi specific antibodies that are capable of enriching immune cells in tumors through dual targeting of pd l1 and immune cells for a synergistic anti tumor effect these bi specific drug candidates have been shown to exhibit unique properties that render tumors more responsive to treatment our discovery expertise when combined with our 147 fit for purpose 148 antibody engineering technology platforms becomes a powerful engine of innovation to create novel molecules our fit for purpose technology platforms our proprietary antibody engineering platforms enable us to accurately capture the biological properties of bi specific antibodies and retain good manufacturability and druggability of the molecules to date we have created seven novel pre clinical stage bi specific drug molecules in addition to our own ig scfv bi specific antibody platform we partnered with abl bio and wuxi biologics to access their antibody engineering platforms in order to increase the probability of success as different molecular configurations require different technologies furthermore our proprietary antibody cytokine technology has enabled another form of bi specific antibodies such as tj l1i7 and tj c4gm that link a tumor engaging antibody with an immuno modulatory cytokine superior to monoclonal antibodies or cytokines alone this class of bi specific antibodies has demonstrated unique properties capable of concentrating the drug molecules in tumors for a desired target effect with reduced systemic toxicity of cytokines or creating biologic synergy that can potentially translate into better treatment outcome our biomarker enabled translational medicine capabilities as we focus on developing innovative drug molecules the ability to apply relevant biomarkers that link a drug response to treatment effects is critical for early stage clinical trials of our investigational drugs this translational medicine capability requires cross functional knowledge and unique skills to link the target biology of an investigational drug to clinical responses we have been developing tailor made biomarkers for each of our investigational drugs which are used to select potential responders predict and measure target engagement support dose determination and enable timely informed decisions on advancing our assets to the next phase of clinical development for example for the development of tjd5 we intend to use cd73 in tumor tissue in combination with other tumor biomarkers to stratify potential target patient populations in our clinical trial to that end we have developed assays to measure cd73 expression and activity in tumor tissues furthermore we have developed specialized assays to measure tjd5 drug concentrations in tumor tissues by linking drug concentration with its activity in the same tumor location these data help us determine appropriate dose selection for further clinical studies our clinical development capabilities our clinical development is led by a global team of clinical scientists industry physicians and experts in portfolio management quantitative science clinical operations drug safety and quality control our clinical team accounts for approximately 80 of our entire r amp d organization 146 s headcount and 80 of our budget allocation the skillset of our clinical development team is highlighted by a combination of extensive global pharma local drug development and operation experiences with clinical networks in china and the united states the team is driven by high ethical standards with passion for improving the lives of patients our team has the ability to integrate internal core development functions to conduct global and local clinical trials we also effectively leverage external resources including clinical contract research organizations academic clinical centers and or networks and global pharmaceutical or biotech partnerships furthermore we have established and implemented a robust internal clinical governance system and processes to safeguard patient safety and data integrity our current clinical development functions and teams are strategically based in shanghai beijing and the united states to cover phase 1 through phase 3 clinical trials in china and early stage clinical trials in the united states table of contents our clinical development capabilities are best demonstrated by the rapid implementation of eight ongoing clinical trials including five phase 1 2 and registrational trials in greater china and three phase 1 trials in the united states within the past three years to ensure regulatory approval and subsequent product launch as currently planned we strive to reach the following critical clinical milestones by the end of 2020 11 active clinical programs consisting of two phase 3 or registrational trials in china two phase 2 trials in china and seven phase 1 trials in the united states and china our global strategic collaborations we have established an excellent track record of in licensing and out licensing deals with our global and regional partners these in licensing deals enable us to acquire multiple innovative clinical stage assets with favorable clinical data packages we have quickly built our china portfolio through in licensing deals with global biotech partners including morphosys genexine macrogenics and ferring as the sublicensee under our agreement with ferring related to olamkicept tj301 over the past three years we have established more than 10 global and regional partnerships with reputable pharma or biotech companies our partners selected us among many china based companies with the belief that we are an ideal partner in china given our strength in science and drug development capability our outstanding track record of execution of rapidly progressing drug development programs in china and the united states and our vision and network to tap into business opportunities and the growing pharmaceutical market in china for example morphosys macrogenics and genexine all stated that we are an ideal or the best partner in china in their press releases or public announcements the out licensing deals enable us to streamline our pipeline and focus our resources on the most valuable assets in addition we seek co development opportunities to share development costs and risks and territorial commercial rights with our partners in the past two years we have out licensed three de prioritized assets and initiated four co development programs with partners such as abl bio and wuxi biologics the revenue from out licensing and co development deals is expected to continue to grow as our

monotherapy and a registrational trial in combination with lenalidomide as a second line therapy both in patients with multiple myeloma in greater china we aim to submit an nda for tj202 as a third line monotherapy in 2021 followed by another nda submission for tj202 as a second line combination therapy moreover we believe tj202 has great market potential in the treatment of pathogenic antibody mediated autoimmune diseases such as sle where there is a significant unmet need for more effective therapies additionally we submitted an ind application to the nmpa in october 2019 for a phase 1b trial for tj202 in sle tj107 is the first long acting recombinant human il 7 known to boost cancer fighting t lymphocytes by increasing their number and function and is being developed as a potential oncology investigational drug the clinical safety and effect of tj107 on t cells have been investigated in multiple previous and ongoing clinical trials in south korea and the united states tj107 is being positioned to address a huge unmet medical need in oncology first tj107 can be an oncology care agent to treat cancer treatment related lymphopenia low blood lymphocyte levels a common condition that occurs in cancer patients who have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy and there is no approved treatment for this condition according to the frost amp sullivan report in greater china the incidence of lymphopenia reached 1 5 million in 2018 and is estimated to increase to 1 7 million in 2023 and further to 2 0 million in 2030 this condition causes further damage to patients 146 already compromised immune system and weakens its ability to fight cancers second tj107 has been shown to synergize with a pd 1 antibody in a tumor table of contents animal model potentially through increased t lymphocyte activation and proliferation we are conducting a phase 1b trial in china to determine a suitable dose range for subsequent trials we expect to start a phase 2 trial in cancer patients in 2020 we are coordinating our study globally with genexine which is conducting a phase 2 clinical trial in south korea and parallel clinical trials in the united states towards clinical poc enoblituzumab is a humanized antibody directed at b7 h3 a member of the b7 family of t cell checkpoint regulators that is widely expressed across multiple tumor types and plays a key role in the regulation of immune response against cancers similar to other inhibitors of the b7 family such as pd l1 targeting b7 h3 potentially provides a treatment option for a variety of cancers expressing b7 h3 enoblituzumab was originally developed by macrogenics and we own the greater china rights of this investigational drug in multiple clinical trials conducted by macrogenics when combined with pembrolizumab in recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 147 scchn 148 and non small cell lung cancer 147 nsclc 148 enoblituzumab has shown favorable clinical results that warrant further investigation we expect to submit an ind application in 2020 for a registrational trial or a phase 2 trial further clinical development is being planned together with macrogenics to extend to other cancer indications in china and globally tj101 if approved is a potential highly differentiated long acting human growth hormone that is being developed as a weekly treatment for pediatric growth hormone deficiency as compared to currently available daily regimens of recombinant human growth hormone rhgh tj101 was originally developed by genexine and we own the greater china rights of this product which has the potential to address an important clinical need and to cover a significant market gap in pediatric growth hormone deficiency according to the frost amp sullivan report there are approximately 3 4 million pediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency in 2018 in greater china but only 3 7 of them receive growth hormone therapies which are mostly daily regimens in a previous phase 2 trial conducted by genexine in south korea and the eu both weekly and bi weekly administration of tj101 demonstrated similar therapeutic effects to daily injection of genotropin a short acting rhgh we are working towards submitting an ind application in 2020 for a phase 3 registrational trial in china highlights of our fast to poc global portfolio our fast to poc global strategy is demonstrated by our global portfolio which mainly consists of our internally developed novel or differentiated biologics our global portfolio focuses on two molecular classes 151 monoclonal antibodies and bi specific antibodies while we have been diligently pursuing our fast to poc global strategy we are aware that there is no assurance that we will always be successful in achieving poc or pivotal development milestones for any of our product candidates in our global portfolio in an accelerated manner see 147 risk factors 148 for a detailed description of the risks related to the development and commercialization of our drug candidates monoclonal antibodies 151 among the five monoclonal antibody drug candidates tjm2 tjc4 and tjd5 are undergoing phase 1 clinical trials in the united states having obtained ind approvals from the nmpa for tjc4 tjd5 and tjm2 we have initiated a phase 1 trial for tjc4 and expect to initiate phase 1 trials for tjd5 and tjm2 in china in early 2020 in addition we are collaborating with shanghai junshi biosciences co ltd or junshi to conduct clinical trials of the combination therapy of tjd5 and junshi 146 s pd 1 monoclonal antibody toripalimab in cancer patients with various types of solid tumors we have not initiated any research and development activities under such collaboration arrangement as of the date of this prospectus tj210 and tjx7 are at the cmc stage and are expected to be ready for ind submissions in 2020 for phase 1 clinical trials in the united states tjc4 is an internally discovered fully human monoclonal antibody targeting cd47 which is one of the most promising immuno oncology targets after pd 1 pd l1 blocking cd47 activates tumor engulfing macrophages a component of the innate immune system as an important cancer fighting mechanism cd47 antibodies are being actively pursued in clinical trials by a few global companies however current development efforts on cd47 antibody drugs are hampered by hematologic side effects such as anemia due to binding to human rbcs for example at least two clinical trials conducted by other companies have been suspended unlike competitor investigational drugs tjc4 is a rare antibody originally selected by design to purposefully avoid or minimize binding to rbcs while maintaining a high antibody affinity and tumor killing properties tjc4 146 s unique property of minimal rbc binding and no significant hematologic changes has been extensively validated in a whole series of robust in vitro assays and primate studies in a glp toxicology study involving 40 monkeys no hematologic side effects were seen even with repeated injections of 100 mg kg doses this unique property may enable tjc4 to be used safely in a broader table of contents patient population to explore its treatment potential in cancers differentiating it from other clinical stage cd47 investigational antibody drugs tjc4 is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial with cancer patients in the united states in parallel leveraging the phase 1 data generated in the united states we plan to begin a phase 1 clinical trial of tjc4 in patients with hematologic malignancies such as aml mds by early 2020 in china in addition we are collaborating with merck sharp amp dohme corp or msd in a phase 1 clinical trial in the united states for the combination therapy of tjc4 and msd 146 s pd 1 inhibitor keytruda pembrolizumab in cancer patients with several types of solid tumors we have not initiated any research and development activities under such collaboration arrangement as of the date of this prospectus bi specific antibody panel 151 this novel antibody class represents an emerging and fast moving area of new drug discovery bi specific antibodies are typically constructed to have a dual specificity of two selected antibodies or combined properties of an antibody linked with a cytokine previously called an immuno cytokine according to the frost amp sullivan report checkpoint inhibitors targeting pd 1 pd l1 had global sales of us 16 3 billion in 2018 and are predicted to reach us 63 4 billion in global sales by 2030 however despite the recent success of checkpoint inhibitors clinical efficacy of these drugs has been unsatisfactory it is estimated that over 60 of cancer patients including those with melanoma renal cell cancer colorectal cancer non small cell lung cancer urothelial cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma do not respond to pd 1 pd l1 monotherapies in addition some patients develop resistance after initial treatment with these therapies as a result the standard of care today leaves many cancer patients underserved there is consensus among cancer immunologists that tumors that do not respond to pd 1 pd l1 treatment have poor immunologic features such as an absence or paucity of tumor fighting immune cells or the presence of dysfunctional immune cells within the tumors collectively known as 147 cold tumors 148 we believe that pd 1 pd l1 non responders can be better treated with novel bi specific antibodies the unique and superior properties of these bi specific antibodies over pd l1 inhibitors alone stem from a second targeting component attached to the pd l1 antibody moiety of the bi specific molecules thereby enabling them to elicit a sufficient immune response and converting a 147 cold tumor 148 to an immune active 147 hot tumor 148 such unique properties of bi specific antibodies cannot be substituted by a combination of the pd l1 antibody with a selected second component either cytokine or antibody in a free form the underlying mechanism is such that the second component must be structurally integrated with the tumor engaging pd l1 antibody in order to concentrate and function inside the tumor which cannot be readily achieved by the two free agents used in combination we have successfully generated a panel of four bi specific antibodies in which our proprietary pd l1 antibody acts as the backbone the first signal and is linked with various second components the second signal including a 4 1bb agonist antibody tj l14b a b7 h3 antibody tj l1h3 a cd47 antibody tj l1c4 and an il 7 cytokine tj l1i7 which are shown to work synergistically with the pd l1 backbone in various assays and cancer animal models this unique panel of bi specific antibodies is only made possible by our proprietary and partnered antibody engineering technologies and the availability of our proprietary monoclonal antibodies furthermore we have generated two other bi specific antibodies tj c4gm and tj cldn4b that are tailor made to function as novel fortified antibodies by linking tjc4 with an engineered gm csf cytokine for the treatment of solid tumors and by linking our claudin 18 2 antibody with a 4 1bb antibody as a unique gastric cancer treatment agent that only activates t cells conditionally upon tumor engagement all bi specific antibodies have been validated in a series of robust in vitro and in vivo studies for biology proof of concept providing a solid basis for clinical validation in cancer patients our strategies moving forward we strive to become a fully integrated end to end global biopharmaceutical company whose capabilities encompass drug discovery gmp manufacturing pre clinical and clinical development and commercialization to achieve this goal we intend to pursue the following strategies rapidly advance our china portfolio towards commercialization we intend to pursue the most efficient pathway to nda approval for the investigational drugs in our china portfolio in the next 12 months we expect to make significant advances with our china portfolio all of the clinical assets of our china portfolio are expected to undergo phase 2 phase 3 or registrational clinical trials in 2020 we plan to submit ndas to the nmpa for these products in sequence from 2021 to 2024 with respect to commercialization capabilities we plan to initially partner with a specialty pharmaceutical company that has existing commercial table of contents capabilities and infrastructure in china to jointly market our leading products once we have acquired commercial experience and developed a distribution network we plan to build a robust internal sales and marketing platform expand our research and development capabilities and footprint in the united states to advance our global portfolio as part of our global strategy we plan to expand our research and development capabilities in the united states to include regulatory affairs translational medicine drug formulation and clinical operations these specific research and development functions in the united states are complementary to and an integral part of our overall research and development capabilities to support clinical development of our global portfolio currently three of our investigational antibody drugs tjm2 tjc4 and tjd5 are in clinical trials in the united states we aim to continue advancing the ongoing clinical trials to phase 2 for clinical validation and to initiate multiple new clinical programs by the end of 2020 or early 2021 in the united states in addition we intend to expand our operational footprint in the united states to create an independent multi functional business entity covering global business development investor relations and corporate communications and other operational capabilities we are in the process of assembling an integrated management team with global experience and extensive track record dedicated to overseeing our operations in the united states build our manufacturing capabilities we believe it is advantageous that we own and control our gmp manufacturing process in order to ensure quality and secure production slots for clinical trial materials and commercial supplies we plan to commence a joint effort to build a comprehensive biologics manufacturing facility in 2020 in china at this planned manufacturing facility we intend to produce drug substance and drug product for clinical use as well as future commercial use we envisage this facility to include a pilot gmp manufacturing plant with two 500 liter and two 2 000 liter single use bioreactors and upon completion of the construction a commercial scale manufacturing plant with eight more 2 000 liter single use bioreactors with filling and finishing lines maximize the value of our pipeline in addition to our successful in licensing efforts we have established a good track record of out licensing collaborations and co development partnerships for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 we recorded revenues of rmb11 6 million rmb53 8 million us 7 5 million and rmb30 0 million us 4 2 million from upfront and milestone payments through three out licensing deals respectively we have reached cost sharing co development deals for some of our drug candidates with multiple global and regional partners these achievements have not only demonstrated our ability to optimize our pipeline but also provided a sustainable revenue stream going forward we plan to enhance our out licensing efforts we expect that the revenue generated from out licensing opportunities will continue to increase and will account for the majority of our net revenue before the commercialization of our marketed products our drug pipeline china portfolio tj202 a potential highly differentiated cd38 antibody for multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases summary 151 tj202 mor202 is a fully human highly differentiated monoclonal antibody directed against cd38 tj202 if approved is positioned as a potential highly differentiated anti cd38 therapy for multiple myeloma 147 mm 148 either as a monotherapy or as a combination therapy with other anti cancer agents we aim to demonstrate the advantages of tj202 including its short infusion time low infusion reaction rate 147 irr 148 and potentially sustained efficacy in our ongoing clinical trials in china additionally as pathogenic cd38 positive b cells and plasma cells are strongly implicated in the disease progression of pathogenic antibody mediated autoimmune diseases we believe the therapeutic value of tj202 can be extended to these diseases that have significant unmet medical needs we have begun to explore its therapeutic application in systemic lupus erythematosus 147 sle 148 and later in other autoimmune diseases in november 2017 we obtained an exclusive license from morphosys to develop tj202 in greater china the development of tj202 is driven by a fast to market strategy we have started registrational trials for a third line monotherapy and a second line treatment trial in combination with lenalidomide both in patients with mm in greater china we aim to submit an nda for tj202 as a third line monotherapy in 2021 followed by another nda submission for tj202 as a second line combination therapy additionally we submitted an ind application to the nmpa in october 2019 and expect to initiate a clinical trial for tj202 in sle patients in 2020 table of contents therapeutic options and current development 151 multiple myeloma mm the treatment options and investigational drugs under development in china include i for small molecule drugs two or three approved drugs known as doublets or triplets are used vrd triplet velcade bortezomib revlimid lenalidomide and dexamethasone has recently been approved for overseas frontline treatment and is recommended in china in the 2017 version of treatment guideline vcd triplet velcade cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone is the most widely adopted first line treatment in china due to its lower cost in 2017 lenalidomide and bortezomib were included in the national reimbursement drug list in china ii with respect to cd38 antibody therapy daratumumab from johnson amp johnson received conditional nda approval from the nmpa in july 2019 and isatuximab from sanofi is in a phase 3 trial in china and iii for car t therapy several phase 1 or 2 clinical trials are ongoing in china however there is no curative treatment for mm although the currently marketed cd38 antibody in china is efficacious it takes a long time to be administered by iv infusion up to six hours and causes a high infusion reaction rate 147 irr 148 in clinical trials approximately half of all patients experience an infusion reaction symptoms of which may include fever chills nausea bronchospasm hypoxia dyspnea hypertension laryngeal edema and pulmonary edema thus there is a need for a safer and convenient to use drug such a drug may be combined with other therapeutic agents for better treatment effects in mm systemic lupus erythematosus sle patients with mild sle are often given non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs while more severe patients may need corticosteroids or immunosuppressants approved by the fda in 2011 and by the nmpa in july 2019 benlysta belimumab a b lymphocyte stimulator blys specific inhibitor developed by gsk is currently the world 146 s only biologic approved to treat sle however there remains a significant unmet medical need beyond belimumab for sle in china and the rest of the world as dysregulated cd38 positive b cells and auto antibodies produced by cd38 positive plasma cells and resulting immune complexes are at the core of the pathogenesis of sle direct inhibition and selective depletion of pathogenic b cells and plasma cells are believed to offer better treatment options our tj202 has the potential to offer such a disease modifying treatment option in addition as described below the advantages of our tj202 include convenience of use and a lower irr making it a more favorable treatment agent in the long term clinical management of sle if approved advantages of tj202 151 tj202 if approved is a potentially highly differentiated cd38 monoclonal antibody and could be the second antibody therapy for mm to launch in china a phase 2a trial of tj202 in mm showed a level of treatment effects comparable to that observed in trials of the currently marketed cd38 antibody however available trial data from morphosys and johnson amp johnson indicate that with similar pre medications of dexamethasone anti pyretics and anti histamines tj202 required only a short infusion time of 0 5 to 2 hours compared to 3 5 to 6 5 hours for the currently marketed cd38 antibody at the first infusion moreover the irr was as low as 7 for tj202 compared to 48 for the currently marketed cd38 antibody the advantages of tj202 associated with infusion may be attributed to its lack of antibody cdc activity and are likely to translate into clinical benefits in terms of tolerability and convenience of use as well as economic benefits due to the cost and length of hospital stay in addition unlike the currently marketed cd38 antibody tj202 treatment does not down regulate cd38 expression on the surface of bone marrow myeloma cells in vitro maintaining sensitivity of malignant myeloma cells to repeated tj202 treatments as tj202 is being considered for long term treatment management of autoimmune diseases we believe such clinical differentiation is critical for autoimmune diseases tj202 has advantages over other b cell targeting therapies such as cd20 antibodies as it specifically targets malfunctioned cd38 high b cells and pathogenic plasma cells involved in autoimmune diseases while cd20 antibodies target most b cells including those involved in normal immune functions and regulatory functions but not plasma cells producing pathogenic antibodies mechanism of action 151 tj202 binds to cd38 overexpressed on the surface of target cells and kills them by inducing antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity 147 adcc 148 and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis 147 adcp 148 the target cells are the malignant plasma cells in mm and a group of dysregulated cd38 high b cells and plasma cells that produce pathogenic antibodies in autoimmune conditions such as sle table of contents tj202 kills cd38 bearing tumor cells by inducing adcc and adcp summary of clinical results 151 morphosys has conducted a phase 1 2a study in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mm in austria and germany study design the open label multicenter dose escalation study was designed to characterize the safety profile and preliminary efficacy of tj202 in adults with relapsed or refractory mm a 3 3 dose escalation design was used to establish the maximum tolerated dose 147 mtd 148 recommended dose and dosing regimen of tj202 as monotherapy weekly or bi weekly with or without dexamethasone 147 dex 148 and in combination with pomalidomide 147 pom 148 and dex or lenalidomide 147 len 148 and dex standard regimens the mtd and recommended dose and dosing regimens were to be confirmed in three confirmation cohorts of at least six evaluable subjects each tj202 dose levels in this study ranged from 0 01 mg kg to 16 0 mg kg administered by intravenous 147 iv 148 infusion the clinical study results as of the data cutoff date december 31 2017 are summarized as follows safety tj202 was well tolerated in patients with rrmm as a single agent and in combination with dex or with pom dex or with len dex the mtd of tj202 was not reached in the 56 patients from three groups receiving combination regimens grade 179 3 adverse events 147 aes 148 were mainly in the hematological system reflected by a decrease of various blood cells this was as expected because of decreased bone marrow function due to the presence of myeloma as well as the expression of cd38 on various cell lineages of the myeloid and lymphoid compartments most of the hematological adverse events were transient and generally manageable tj202 was administered as a two hour iv infusion at first dose and infusion time could be reduced to as short as 30 minutes at subsequent doses without obvious safety concerns among all cohorts infusion related reactions including tachycardia pyrexia and hypersensitivity occurred in 18 of 91 patients 19 8 and were mostly mild to moderate in the combination cohorts containing dex a very low irr 4 out of 56 patients 7 was observed these results compared favorably with the historical data of the currently marketed cd38 antibody clinical efficacy preliminary efficacy results were based on 56 patients from three groups treated with tj202 combination therapies no responses were observed for the monotherapy groups which were primarily serving for dose escalation tj202 in combination with low dose dex pom dex or len dex demonstrated an overall response rate 147 orr 148 of 28 48 and 65 respectively durable responses were observed as median

most subjects steady state at 16 mg kg was observed after the fourth infusion terminal half life at high dose levels 179 4 mg kg was at approximately two weeks pharmacokinetics of tj202 were generally consistent across different individuals and dosing days and not affected by the co medications immunogenicity no anti drug antibody 147 ada 148 against tj202 was observed as of the cut off date thus risk of ada induction for tj202 in humans is considered low clinical development plan 151 immediately after in licensing tj202 we formulated a robust clinical development strategy with an aim for an nda submission by 2021 with an approved ind we have started a single arm registrational trial with tj202 and dex as a third line therapy for mm patients in greater china using orr as the primary endpoint nct03860038 dosing of the first patient took place in march 2019 data from this 82 patient study are expected to be the major package supporting registrational filing for conditional approval in 2021 in parallel we started a registrational trial combining tj202 with len and dex as a second line combination therapy in mm patients nct03952091 we plan to enroll 291 patients for full approval dosing of the first patient took place in taiwan in april 2019 we have recruited a total of 19 patients for both registrational trials our clinical development plan for sle starts with a phase 1b clinical trial to explore dose range clinical safety and tolerability as well as tj202 146 s profiles of pk and pharmacodynamics 147 pd 148 in sle patients additionally we submitted an ind application to the nmpa in october 2019 tj107 efineptakin the first long acting recombinant human il 7 with the potential for cancer treatment related lymphopenia and cancer immunotherapy summary 151 tj107 international nonproprietary name 147 inn 148 efineptakin is the world 146 s first and only long acting recombinant human interleukin 7 147 rhil 7 148 which is being developed as a t lymphocyte booster for cancer related immunotherapy due to its advantages in terms of selective immune functions improved stability developability and extended half life tj107 is differentiated from an earlier generation of short acting rhil 7 and t cell growth factor interleukin 2 in december 2017 we acquired exclusive rights from genexine to develop and commercialize tj107 in greater china we plan to position tj107 first as a monotherapy or an oncology care product for cancer patients with cancer treatment related lymphopenia low blood lymphocyte levels induced by chemotherapy or radiation therapy this target indication covers a large population of cancer patients who develop cancer treatment related lymphopenia a condition that weakens the ability to receive continued chemotherapy or radiation therapy and leads to worsened disease prognosis and clinical outcome currently there is no treatment available for this condition second tj107 is expected to show a therapeutic effect as a combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors i e pd 1 pd l1 therapies due to its inherent selective t cell boosting properties pre clinical studies have indicated that tj107 exerted additional anti tumor effect when combined with pd 1 pd l1 therapies if proven efficacious in clinical studies we believe such a combination therapy can potentially treat a large table of contents population of cancer patients who do not respond or respond poorly to pd 1 pd l1 therapies we are conducting a phase 1b study in china to determine a suitable dose range for subsequent trials we expect to start a phase 2 trial in cancer patients in 2020 therapeutic options and current development 151 one of the target therapeutic indications of tj107 is cancer treatment related lymphopenia cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy and or radiation therapy often develop cancer treatment related lymphopenia which further damages their already compromised immune systems and their ability to fight against cancers according to the frost amp sullivan report more than 85 of all cancer patients receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy and 43 of these patients develop lymphopenia which represents a significant unmet medical need as currently no drug is available for the treatment of lymphopenia advanced solid tumor is another indication of tj107 as a combination therapy with pd 1 pd l1 treatments as more than 60 cancer patients either do not respond or respond poorly to current pd 1 pd l1 therapies there are intense attempts to identify an effective agent that can work synergistically with pd 1 pd l1 therapies to increase the probability of treatment success tj107 is believed to provide such a treatment option which is supported by pre clinical reports that il 7 exhibits a synergistic effect with pd 1 pd l1 antibodies in the treatment of cancers advantages of tj107 151 tj107 has an advantage over other t lymphocyte cytokines with therapeutic potential in oncology pre clinical and clinical results generated so far indicate that tj107 has a favorable immune function profile over recombinant human interleukin 2 147 rhil 2 148 in that tj107 activates and expands tumor fighting cd4 cd8 and natural killer t cells but spares tumor protecting treg cells by contrast rhil 2 is a well known inducer of tregs which suppresses tumor fighting effector t cells furthermore rhil 2 has a narrow therapeutic window and causes serious side effects such as capillary leak syndrome breathing problems serious infections and seizures a polyethylene glycol peg conjugated il 2 variant recently developed by nektar therapeutics has yielded mixed results indicating the complexity associated with using il 2 as a cancer treatment owing to its preferred immune function and molecular profiles demonstrated in pre clinical and phase 1 2 clinical trials we believe that tj107 is a superior t cell cytokine investigational drug for cancer treatment related lymphopenia and cancer immunotherapy tj107 as an engineered rhil 7 has the advantages of improved stability and half life extension through genexine 146 s proprietary hybrid fragment crystallizable region 147 hyfc 148 introducing a few hydrophilic amino acid residues to the n terminus of il 7 overcomes stability issues that hampered the development of previous rhil 7 drug candidates furthermore application of the hyfc technology enhances il 7 146 s function increases its half life from 48 to 112 hours after a single subcutaneous 147 sc 148 dose in clinical studies and allows for a robust purification process by contrast the half life of first generation rhil 7 was reported to be about 12 hours after sc dosing in human subjects the hyfc in tj107 is also non cytolytic so it will not damage the t cells to which it binds unlike tj107 the previous rhil 7 drug candidates adopt non glycosylated cyt 99 007 or glycosylated cyt 107 forms of short acting rhil 7 and were developed by revimmune inc formerly known as cytheris sa these molecules had low stability low production yield and a short half life because il 7 protein is intrinsically unstable and prone to aggregation however the preliminary clinical results from phase 1 and phase 2 trials in patients with aids did show an increase of t lymphocytes following treatment with cyt 107 thiebaut r et al plos comput biol 2014 mechanism of action 151 il 7 is a cytokine essential for the survival and homeostatic proliferation of naive and memory t cells see figure below il 7 is critically involved in restoring t cells to normal levels in the event of lymphopenia by stimulating t cell proliferation il 7 exerts its functions by binding to and activating the il 7 receptor which is expressed primarily on lymphocytes including the lymphoid precursors developing t and b cells naive t cells and memory t cells but not on tumor protecting tregs tj107 as a monotherapy may enhance anti tumor immunity by augmenting the number and functionality of t cells whereas tj107 in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor cancer vaccine or car t may improve the anti tumor response by restoring t cell numbers reconstituting t cell pools and reinvigorating exhausted t cells table of contents role of il 7 in t cell maintenance and proliferation summary of clinical results 151 a first in human phase 1 trial has been conducted by genexine in south korea this was a randomized double blind placebo controlled single ascending dose study to evaluate the safety tolerability pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 20 or 60 micro g kg tj107 via sc or intramuscular 147 im 148 administration in healthy volunteers each dose group consisted of 10 subjects eight of whom were administered tj107 and two were given placebo via the same route of administration safety tj107 was well tolerated in all 30 subjects without serious adverse events the most common adverse events were transient grade 1 or 2 injection site skin reactions pharmacodynamics 147 pd 148 because il 7 promotes the survival and proliferation of t cells absolute lymphocyte count 147 alc 148 in the peripheral blood was used as a reliable and convenient pd marker for tj107 see figure below alc initially decreased transiently in all tj107 groups this effect is often termed margination which is a physiological phenomenon common to many cytokines as a result of increased adherence of cytokine stimulated white blood cells to the blood vessels and subsequent trafficking to tissues and lymphoid organs alc recovered in approximately seven days reaching a maximum value at close to 21 days before gradually declining this result indicated that a single dose of tj107 had a long lasting effect of increasing lymphocyte levels overall a greater increase in alc was observed in cohort 2 compared with cohort 1 demonstrating a dose dependent response additionally a higher increase in alc was observed in cohort 3 compared with cohort 2 which was consistent with the results of an animal study where im injection induced a more effective increase in lymphocytes than sc injection table of contents median fold changes of alc following a single dose of tj107 in humans cohort 1 20 micro g kg sc cohort 2 60 micro g kg sc and cohort 3 60 micro g kg im source genexine tj107 treatment resulted in a substantial increase in the number of cd4 and cd8 t cells

resulting in a half life of 48 to 112 hours longer than that reported for the first generation rhil 7 about 12 hours intramuscular tj107 showed approximately two fold greater exposure than sc administration at the same dose level of 60 micro g kg the higher plasma exposure of tj107 after im administration was well correlated with a more robust pd effect on alc in cohort 3 immunogenicity adas were detected in 22 of 24 subjects treated with tj107 one subject in cohort 3 was positive for adas before treatment neutralizing antibodies were observed in 42 and 46 of the subjects within one to two months following administration respectively but only one person still harbored neutralizing adas five months after administration table of contents the clinical relevance of ada was evaluated during long term follow up monitoring alc levels were maintained above the baseline values endogenous il 7 was maintained at normal levels and no specific adverse events associated with adas were observed these results are consistent with well documented reports that a normal individual can harbor pre existing auto antibodies for cytokines such as il 2 il 3 il 4 and il 7 and that these anti cytokine antibodies tend to serve as a reservoir and carrier of the cytokines in the blood extending the half life of these cytokines and preserving their functions clinical development plan 151 by leveraging the results of genexine 146 s ongoing clinical trials in south korea and the united states we aim to rapidly advance the clinical development of tj107 for approval in greater china currently a phase 1b trial in china is ongoing to investigate the safety tolerability and pk pd response of tj107 in patients with advanced solid cancers the clinical trial nct04001075 is designed to include i dose escalation of tj107 using a conventional 147 3 3 148 study design to identify a safe and active dose range and ii dose expansion to confirm the safety and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy we have finished dose escalation for the first two patient cohorts and the safety and tolerability profile as well as the pk pd response are consistent with other ongoing studies of tj107 after determining the recommended phase 2 dose 147 rp2d 148 in the phase 1b trial we expect to start a phase 2 trial in cancer patients in 2020 genexine has initiated a dose finding trial in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with solid tumors meanwhile genexine is also sponsoring additional early stage clinical trials in advanced solid tumors including glioblastoma and high risk skin cancer in the united states and south korea the safety pharmacology and preliminary efficacy data from these ongoing studies are expected to significantly facilitate our clinical development of tj107 in greater china tj101 a potential highly differentiated long acting growth hormone for growth hormone deficiency summary 151 tj101 if approved is a potential highly differentiated long acting recombinant human growth hormone 147 rhgh 148 inn eftansomatropin being developed as a more convenient and effective therapy for growth hormone deficiency 147 ghd 148 for which there is substantial unmet medical need in china tj101 met the pre set safety endpoints in three multi regional clinical trials conducted in europe and asia and preliminary efficacy endpoints in pre pubertal growth hormone naive pediatric growth hormone deficient 147 pghd 148 patients in contrast to marketed short acting rhgh such as genotropin tj101 showed similar efficacy results in a weekly vs daily regimen furthermore tj101 has not shown the safety concerns typically associated with approved pegylated drugs we in licensed the china rights to tj101 from genexine and are positioning tj101 as a highly differentiated growth hormone replacement therapy because of its advantages over a daily regimen in terms of injection frequency weekly vs daily and safety profile natural protein based vs pegylated long acting rhgh especially in pediatric patients we are preparing for a registrational phase 3 trial in china to validate the efficacy safety pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of tj101 in pghd with a plan for ind submission in 2020 therapeutic options and current development 151 our current therapeutic indication is pghd the widely adopted treatment for pghd is patient specific growth hormone replacement therapy which is given in a calculated weight based dosing regimen currently short acting recombinant human growth hormone 147 rhgh 148 is commonly used for the long term treatment of children and adults with inadequate endogenous growth hormone secretion there are certain safety concerns related to long term use of pegylated drugs such as potential renal toxicity cellular vacuolation and formation of anti polyethylene glycol antibodies approved by the nmpa in 2014 jintrolong developed by genescience is currently the only marketed long acting pegylated rhgh in china according to the frost amp sullivan report other companies in china currently developing long acting rhgh include anhui anke biotechnology xiamen amoytop biotech generon pharmaceutical technology and visen pharmaceuticals our tj101 is the only fc based long acting rhgh ready for a phase 3 clinical trial in china according to the frost amp sullivan report only 3 7 of all pghd patients in china were receiving growth hormone replacement therapy in 2018 which primarily consists of daily injections of rhgh before sleep this dosing regimen puts a substantial burden on pediatric patients and their families because it requires drug preparation and needle injection every day which is painful and extremely inconvenient often resulting in poor patient compliance more importantly studies have shown that skipping just one or two doses in a week can markedly reduce the efficacy of table of contents the treatment therefore there is a substantial unmet medical need for long acting growth hormone therapies that are similarly efficacious but with reduced injection frequency and the market potential for such a long acting rhgh in china is largely untapped in addition recombinant human growth hormone therapy has been included in the national reimbursement drug list nrdl in china inclusion of a drug in the nrdl typically results in a much higher sales volume and significant sales growth despite a reduction in price advantages of tj101 151 we believe that tj101 has the following advantages i when compared to the daily regimen of rhgh tj101 is expected to be a more convenient therapy with better patient compliance due to a reduced dosing frequency to either weekly or twice monthly administration while maintaining similar efficacy and ii tj101 has not shown safety concerns typically associated with pegylated drugs such as potential renal toxicity pre existing or treatment induced anti peg antibodies and cellular vacuolation in macrophages renal tubule cells and the choroid plexus epithelial cells mechanism of action 151 like endogenous growth hormone tj101 stimulates the production of insulin like growth factor 1 147 igf 1 148 in the liver which has growth stimulating effects on a variety of tissues including osteoblast and chondrocyte activities that stimulate bone growth thus igf 1 is a reliable pharmacodynamic marker and more importantly the key mediator of tj101 146 s growth promoting activity tj101 is based on genexine 146 s patented hyfc technology the hyfc part consists of a portion of human immunoglobulin d 147 igd 148 and g 4 147 igg 4 148 the former contains a flexible hinge and the latter is responsible for half life extension through neonatal fc receptor 147 fcrn 148 mediated recycling additionally tj101 146 s increased

human growth hormone source genexine summary of clinical results 151 genexine has completed three clinical trials with tj101 including one phase 1 trial in healthy adult volunteers one phase 1b 2 multi regional trial in adults with ghd and one phase 2 multi regional trial in pghd in europe altogether involving 32 healthy subjects and 99 patients with ghd and pghd overall tj101 was shown to be well tolerated and clinical efficacy endpoint achieved by weekly or twice monthly tj101 administration was comparable to that of daily administration of genotropin phase 1 clinical trial 151 the first in human trial of tj101 was a randomized double blind placebo controlled single dose ascending study in four groups of healthy subjects a total of 32 subjects were enrolled and 31 completed the study

subject from cohort 2 1 2 mg kg week of tj101 discontinued due to retinal vascular disorder the data and safety monitoring board 147 dsmb 148 reviewed this case independently concluding that the retinal finding was more likely to be of completely different etiology than treatment induced intracranial hypertension one subject from cohort 3 2 4 mg kg twice monthly of tj101 discontinued due to pseudopapilloedema optic disc drusen which was assessed by the principal investigator to be mild with continuous frequency and possibly related to the study drug injection site reactions 147 isrs 148 were reported by 13 out of 40 subjects 32 5 in the tj101 cohorts pain was the most prominent and common symptom observed in 10 subjects also six subjects reported redness four reported itching and one reported bruising swelling and warmness with respect to the genotropin cohort pain was the only isr reported in 683 cases by 11 out of 14 subjects 78 5 none of the isrs led to discontinuation of treatment and most of the reported isrs posed no issue for the subjects and were resolved quickly no safety signal was detected in laboratory parameters or vital signs for either tj101 or genotropin pharmacokinetics half life of tj101 was 77 75 150 141 95 hours after a single dose and 43 92 150 55 66 hours compared to 5 27 hours for genotropin after three months of multiple dose administration immunogenicity formation of treatment emergent ada with neutralizing property was reported in two subjects one from cohort 2 and one from cohort 3 out of a total of 40 subjects randomized and dosed with tj101 with respect to the genotropin cohort the presence of treatment emergent ada with neutralizing property was not observed in any subject clinical efficacy subcutaneous administration of tj101 over the dose range of 0 8 mg kg week 150 2 4 mg kg twice monthly resulted in an increase in ahv over the six month study period subjects who received tj101 at 0 8 mg kg weekly 1 2 mg kg weekly and 2 4 mg kg twice monthly showed growth rates of 11 50 11 54 and 11 86 cm year respectively while the growth rate in the control group treated with genotropin was approximately 11 24 cm year table of contents the ahv at six months indicated comparable growth rates between all doses of tj101 both weekly and twice monthly treatment and the active comparator genotropin source genexine pharmacodynamics the growth promoting effect of tj101 was accompanied by elevated serum igf 1 levels this hormone is an important biomarker which mediates growth hormone 146 s biological effects the standard deviation score 147 sds 148 which is a calculated score with reference to the normal age and sex matched igf 1 levels is a standardized parameter to compare igf 1 levels across laboratories and populations mean igf 1 sds at the beginning of the study was below the lower limit of the normal range in all treatment arms following initiation of treatment the igf 1 sds values quickly normalized by five days visit 2 and three weeks visit 3 after the initial treatment respectively for the tj101 treatment arms and the genotropin treatment arm igf 1 responses were maintained throughout the intended dosing interval supporting both the weekly and twice monthly treatment regimens igf 1 mean peak levels were mostly within the upper limit of the physiologic range which is considered safe in clinical practice clinical development plan 151 based on genexine 146 s phase 2 study in pghd we are preparing to conduct a registrational phase 3 randomized active controlled and multi center study in china to assess the efficacy safety and pharmacokinetics of tj101 in pghd the primary objective is to demonstrate non inferiority of 1 2 mg kg week of tj101 administered sc based on ahv after 26 weeks of treatment compared to the active control jintropin a daily rhgh marketed in china we have finalized the study design with key opinion leaders and our development plan and study design have been discussed with the nmpa through a face to face pre ind meeting we are working towards submitting an ind application in 2020 tj301 a potential highly differentiated il 6 blocker for ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune diseases summary 151 tj301 inn olamkicept is the only clinical stage selective interleukin 6 147 il 6 148 inhibitor that works through the trans signaling mechanism il 6 is an important cytokine driver in the propagation and maintenance of chronic inflammation in autoimmune diseases compared to the approved antibody drugs that directly block il 6 or il 6 receptor 147 il 6r 148 tj301 is expected to provide a novel alternative for the treatment of il 6 mediated inflammation without affecting some of the normal physiological functions of il 6 e g acute immune response against infection and metabolic regulation tj301 demonstrated therapeutic effects in pre clinical animal models of autoimmune diseases including inflammatory colitis moreover the safety and tolerability profile of tj301 was studied in three clinical trials in germany involving 128 subjects we believe that tj301 has the potential to become a highly differentiated therapy to target autoimmune diseases we acquired an exclusive license from ferring pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize tj301 in greater china and south korea with an option of licensing worldwide rights as part of our fast to market strategy for tj301 we are conducting a phase 2 clinical trial in ulcerative colitis 147 uc 148 for the following reasons i tj301 was shown to be effective in animal models of colitis ii an exploratory phase 2a biomarker trial showed promising interim treatment effects of tj301 in uc patients and iii even though uc incidence is increasing rapidly innovative biologic treatments for this disease are lacking in china we expect to obtain preliminary data from this phase 2 clinical trial by the second half of 2020 after clinical table of contents efficacy and differentiation are validated for uc we plan to develop tj301 in other inflammatory indications in which il 6 plays a role therapeutic options and current development 151 our current therapeutic indication for development is uc uc and crohn 146 s disease 147 cd 148 are the main types of inflammatory bowel disease 147 ibd 148 which cause chronic and often relapsing inflammation of the large and small intestines respectively anti inflammatory drugs such as 5 aminosalicylic acids 147 5 asas 148 and corticosteroids are often used as initial treatment for uc immune system suppressors are also used to control inflammation in patients with uc including azathioprine mercaptopurine and cyclosporine biologics that inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf 097 including infliximab remicade adalimumab humira and golimumab simponi are efficacious in some uc patients who fail to respond to conventional therapies entyvio an integrin 097 4 szlig 7 antibody that blocks lymphocytes from accumulating in the intestinal wall is the first and to date the only non anti tnf 097 biologics approved for uc in china remicade is currently the only biologic approved for treatment of uc there is a substantial unmet medical need in uc for a treatment agent s that is efficacious and safe through pathways beyond the traditional drug targets the incidence of uc is increasing rapidly but uc patients especially those with a moderate to severe disease have few treatment options which have limited efficacy and considerable side effects for example jak1 3 kinase inhibitors can carry the risk of serious infections and malignancies tnf 097 inhibitors also have inherent side effects and do not work in all patients according to the frost amp sullivan report approximately 45 patients with autoimmune diseases are considered treatment non responders to tnf 097 drugs and less than one third the uc patients taking tnf 097 drugs achieve drug free remission thus as the only clinical stage selective interleukin 6 147 il 6 148 inhibitor that works through the trans signaling mechanism we believe tj301 has the potential to become a highly differentiated il 6 blocker for uc if approved advantages of tj301 151 the existing il 6 or il 6r blockers cause total inhibition of il 6 signaling and are associated with significant adverse events in the clinic such as infection gastrointestinal perforation metabolic disturbances and insulin resistance tj301 is expected to provide a novel alternative as it works through a different mechanism the trans signaling pathway this key advantage has been demonstrated in pre clinical studies and three clinical trials conducted in germany the results indicated that tj301 has no side effects on lipid glucose or bone metabolism and it has no agonistic activities that could activate receptors or trigger detrimental immune cascades we expect that selective inhibition of il 6 trans signaling is an effective and safer approach to the treatment of chronic inflammation mechanism of action 151 tj301 is a homodimer of a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains of human glycoprotein130 147 gp130 148 and the fragment crystallizable fc domain of human igg 1 mimicking the function of endogenous soluble gp130 tj301 works as a decoy by binding to a complex consisting of il 6 and soluble il 6 receptor 147 sil 6r 148 thereby preventing tj301 from stimulating the trans signaling pathway in cells that do not express il 6r the gp130 part selectively binds the il 6 sil 6r complex with high affinity kd 130 pm whereas the fc part initiates dimerization and offers longer half life for the molecule tj301 is not expected to affect the beneficial effects of il 6 such as the acute immune response against infection mediated by the classical pathway table of contents classical signaling and trans signaling pathways of il 6 anti il 6r and anti il 6 block both pathways whereas tj301 blocks only trans signaling il 6r il 6 receptor sil 6r soluble il 6 receptor summary of clinical results 151 ferring pharmaceuticals has completed two phase 1 trials to evaluate tj301 146 s preliminary safety and clinical pharmacology tj301 was shown to be well tolerated based on the clinical results collected from a total of 112 subjects exposed to the drug in addition a phase 2a biomarker study in active ibd known as the future study has been completed in germany with promising pharmacodynamic and clinical responses observed phase 1 clinical trial single dose ascending trial study design the first in human trial

similar serum exposure was observed after the first and last dosing events with respect to cmax and total exposure over 14 days maximal serum drug concentration after each dosing was reached at the end of infusion the mean terminal half life of tj301 after the last administration was approximately 5 1 days circulating biological activity of tj301 was confirmed by whole blood stat3 phosphorylation assays in all patients a minimal and transient ada production was observed in three patients adas were only detected at week 12 and week 15 but no longer detectable at week 18 time course of the mean serum concentration of tj301 pharmacodynamics in the assessment of the primary endpoint it was observed that clinical remission was associated with a significant reduction of il 1b il 8 and reg1a gene expression in the intestinal mucosa pathway analysis of blood transcriptome signatures showed an early molecular anti inflammatory signature as early as four hours after treatment in all patients irrespective of treatment outcome which indicated a thorough inhibitory effect of il 6 trans signaling blockade on inflammatory pathways clinical efficacy a preliminary clinical response was observed in both uc and cd patients which appeared to be stronger in patients with uc than those with cd overall 55 of uc patients 5 9 responded to tj301 with 22 2 9 reaching clinical remission whereas 29 of cd patients 2 7 responded to tj301 with 14 1 7 reaching clinical remission all three patients in clinical remission showed a fast and thorough induction of clinical endoscopic and immunologic remission within the first four weeks clinical development plan 151 we are positioning tj301 as a differentiated il 6 blocker for a number of autoimmune diseases the first target indication is active stage uc that is not well controlled by conventional therapies such as mesalazine we have initiated a multi regional phase 2 clinical trial in greater china and south korea to assess the pharmacokinetics safety and efficacy of tj301 in patients with active uc nct03235752 this is a randomized double blind and placebo controlled clinical trial with three treatment arms we plan to enroll 90 patients a total of 58 patients have been dosed we expect to obtain preliminary data from this phase 2 clinical trial by the second half of 2020 table of contents besides uc we are evaluating the possibility of extending tj301 to other autoimmune conditions where there is significant unmet medical need in china we expect to initiate a second clinical trial for a chronic inflammatory disorder such as systemic sclerosis and castleman 146 s disease in which il 6 is implicated as a key pathogenic cytokine enoblituzumab the most advanced clinical stage humanized b7 h3 antibody as a potential immuno oncology treatment summary 151 enoblituzumab is a humanized antibody directed at b7 h3 a member of the b7 family of t cell checkpoint regulators b7 h3 is a promising immuno oncology drug target as it is widely expressed across multiple tumor types and plays a key role in regulating immune response against cancers increasing pre clinical and clinical evidence suggests that antibodies targeting the two t cell checkpoint molecules 150 150 b7 h3 and pd 1 150 150 work synergistically in treating cancer given b7 h3 146 s critical role enoblituzumab has a wide range of cancer applications as either a monotherapy or in combination with pd 1 therapies at the molecular level enoblituzumab is engineered to possess an enhanced anti tumor adcc function and is at the forefront in global clinical development originally developed by macrogenics enoblituzumab has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials as a monotherapy or in combination with ctla 4 or pd 1 therapies in patients with b7 h3 expressing cancers enoblituzumab is also being evaluated in a neoadjuvant phase 2 study as a single agent in patients with intermediate and high risk localized prostate cancer the clinical studies so far have shown that enoblituzumab is well tolerated and it increased cd8 t cell infiltration in tumors with more focused t cell repertoires in patients treated with enoblituzumab as a monotherapy recent clinical studies conducted by macrogenics indicate that combination therapy with enoblituzumab and pembrolizumab correlates with preliminary anti tumor effects in recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 147 scchn 148 and non small cell lung cancer 147 nsclc 148 we recently acquired the development and commercial rights of enoblituzumab from macrogenics for greater china we expect to submit an ind application in 2020 for a registrational trial or a phase 2 trial as more clinical and pre clinical data become available further clinical trials will be planned together with macrogenics to extend enoblituzumab to other cancer indications in china and globally therapeutic options and current development 151 our initial therapeutic indication is head and neck cancer head and neck cancers occur in various parts of the head and neck including the mouth nose throat and salivary glands more than 90 of head and neck cancers are classified as scchn which begin in the squamous cells that line the moist mucosal surfaces inside the head and neck the treatment principles and regimens for head and neck cancer in china are similar to those in the rest of the world treatment strategies often depend on the location and stage of the cancer the patient 146 s physical status and response to prior treatments early stage disease is primarily treated with surgical resection while patients with locally advanced recurrent or metastatic disease are typically treated with drug therapy the combination of surgery and drug therapy with or without radiation therapy is the current standard of care for stage 3 scchn patients with locally advanced disease platinum based chemotherapy regimens are widely used as first line therapies for stage 4 and distant relapse patients erbitux cetuximab from eli lilly and merck kgaa was approved in 2006 as a first line treatment of locally advanced scchn in combination with radiation therapy regimens containing erbitux platinum based chemotherapy and 5 fluorouracil known as extreme are often considered as the standard of care for first line treatment of distant relapse scchn however only about 35 of patients respond to extreme and the resulting overall median survival is only 10 1 months furthermore about half of the patients on first line therapies need later line therapies in addition even second line therapy is highly varied including single agent docetaxel or paclitaxel erbitux monotherapy and erbitux and paclitaxel combination therapy in 2016 pd 1 inhibitors were approved globally as second line therapies recently keytruda pembrolizumab from merck amp co used as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy was approved by the fda as first line therapy for patients with metastatic or unresectable recurrent scchn the average orr for second line therapies has been less than 15 as such we believe that scchn patients especially those with late stage or relapsed disease need more efficacious treatments with fewer side effects which represents a significant unmet medical need for immunotherapy and targeted therapy table of contents advantages of enoblituzumab 151 enoblituzumab is the most advanced clinical stage humanized b7 h3 antibody as a potential immuno oncology treatment the foregoing statement applies only to conventional therapeutic b7 h3 antibodies and does not include radio labeled b7 h3 antibodies in development by y mabs therapeutics targeting b7 h3 offers several advantages over other target options within the class of t cell checkpoint molecules first b7 h3 is a tumor associated antigen that is over expressed in a variety of solid tumors while its expression in normal tissues is rather limited enabling the tumor killing mechanism of enoblituzumab second b7 h3 is a unique checkpoint whose expression in tumors is associated with disease prognosis for example biomarker analysis of more than 400 nsclc patients revealed that among all the elevated immune checkpoint inhibitors including pd 1 pd l1 pd l2 b7 h3 tim 3 btla and ctla4 only b7 h3 is negatively correlated with clinical efficacies of neoadjuvant treatments lou et al clinical cancer research 2016 furthermore recent studies have shown that when combined with a pd 1 antibody a blockade of b7 h3 results in superior treatment effects in relevant cancer animal models while another study indicates that b7 h3 expression correlates with a lack of anti pd 1 response yonesaka et al clinical cancer research 2018 the advantages summarized above make b7 h3 a favorable tumor target for immuno therapeutic intervention mechanism of action 151 enoblituzumab mga271 is an investigational humanized immunoglobulin igg1 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to b7 homolog 3 b7 h3 this antibody consists of an engineered human igg1 fragment crystallizable fc domain that imparts increased affinity for the human activating fc gamma receptor fc 103 r iiia cd16a and decreased affinity for the human inhibitory fc 103 riib cd32b the engineered fc domain confers enoblituzumab with enhanced target specific antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity 147 adcc 148 in vitro and anti tumor activity in preclinical studies therefore enhanced cytolysis of b7 h3 expressing tumor cells is a mechanism that supports the development of this molecule as an antineoplastic agent in addition data suggest that enoblituzumab impacts t cell homeostasis in vivo cancer patients display a more narrowly focused t cell repertoire following enoblituzumab treatment compared to their baseline repertoire distribution moreover enhanced local t cell infiltration has been observed in prostate cancer patients treated with enoblituzumab these data are consistent with the notion that enoblituzumab is capable of engaging both innate and adaptive immunity as mediators of its anti tumor activity enoblituzumab contributes to the coordination and engagement of innate and adaptive immunity to mediate tumor regression enoblituzumab binds to tumor cells activates innate immune cells such as natural killer cells nk cells to kill cancer cells through adcc the released tumor antigens may then be presented by antigen presenting cells such as macrophages which in concert with pd 1 blockade can promote tumor specific t cell immunity source macrogenics table of contents

of this study will be objective response rate orr performed by central review in addition we are planning to explore enoblituzumab development in a variety of b7 h3 expressing solid tumors macrogenics plans to combine enoblituzumab and a pd 1 antibody with and without chemotherapy in a two part phase 2 3 study for first line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic scchn not curable by localized therapy we expect to participate in the phase 3 global study if initiated global portfolio tjm2 a gm csf monoclonal antibody for rheumatoid arthritis and car t related therapies summary 151 tjm2 is an internally discovered neutralizing antibody against human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor 147 gm csf 148 an important cytokine that plays a critical role in chronic inflammation and destruction in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 147 ra 148 tjm2 is expected to be the first clinical stage gm csf monoclonal antibody in china tjm2 is a humanized igg1 that displays high affinity binding to gm csf and blocks its signaling and downstream effects tjm2 is being developed for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including ra cytokine release syndrome 147 crs 148 and neuroinflammation from car t therapy we have completed a single dose first in human study in healthy volunteers in the united states we have received ind approval from the nmpa for a multiple dose phase 1b study in chinese patients with ra and may expand to other autoimmune and inflammatory indications with high unmet medical need where gm csf is known as a pathogenic cytokine in disease activity and progression tjm2 is expected to be the first compound of its class to enter clinical trial in china in early 2020 if approved it is expected to provide an effective treatment option as a disease modifying anti rheumatic drug 147 dmard 148 therapy therapeutic options and current development 151 our current therapeutic indication is ra a systemic chronic inflammatory disease considered to be one of the most prevalent immune mediated inflammatory diseases ra is nearly always polyarticular and causes joint destruction deformity and loss of function extra articular manifestations include cardiopulmonary diseases eye diseases sjogren 146 s syndrome rheumatoid vasculitis and neurological diseases current therapies for ra in china include traditional chinese medicine corticosteroids and dmards including immunosuppressants and targeted therapies such as tnf inhibitors although the market for ra has become more competitive in china new medicines targeting different pathways with greater clinical efficacy and safety remain a significant unmet need our gm csf antibody targets an entirely different disease pathway and has these desired characteristics to treat ra clinical evidence supporting the role of a gm csf antibody in ra is highlighted in a few recent global studies for example both otilimab mor103 a gm csf antibody from morphosys and gsk and mavrilimumab a gm csf receptor antibody from medimmune have shown an early onset of clinical responses in phase 2 proof of concept trials with ra patients in addition to ra attempts to develop a gm csf antibody for treating other autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis are being studied by amgen and takeda these autoimmune conditions involve the same autoimmune cell types including macrophages and neutrophils and the same connective tissues such as bones joints and tendons given the large patient population affected and the burden of these diseases we are keen to explore the therapeutic role of tjm2 in treating these diseases if initial studies in ra patients meet primary end points the therapeutic role of tjm2 goes beyond autoimmune diseases a recent study indicates that gm csf plays a critical role in serious side effects associated with chimeric antigen receptor car t therapy such as cytokine release syndrome 147 crs 148 and neurotoxicity as car t therapy has become an effective treatment option for certain table of contents cancer types finding a treatment solution for car t related toxicities that occur frequently and can turn into a serious and potentially fatal condition becomes an urgent need these severe toxicities add to the morbidity and mortality of car t therapy crs is caused by a massive release of circulating cytokines by expanding car t cells and gm csf is one of the key cytokines of crs currently there are no effective therapies to prevent crs or neurotoxicity tocilizumab an il 6 receptor antagonist is approved for severe crs with limited therapeutic coverage recent studies indicate that neutralizing gm csf in vivo may ameliorate and potentially prevent crs and neuroinflammation without affecting car t cell activity humanigen recently teamed up with kite to evaluate lenzilumab a gm csf antibody as a preventive or treatment agent in association with yescarta an approved cd19 directed car t therapy in parallel with an ra clinical trial we are seeking opportunities to co develop tjm2 as a treatment option for crs associated with car t therapy advantages of tjm2 151 based on reported clinical findings with front runner gm csf antibodies compared to other ra biologics that are clinically used we have the following expectations fast onset of therapeutic effect because gm csf acts at a relatively early stage in the inflammatory cascade gm csf blockade is expected to take effect after just a few initial doses and provide quick symptomatic relief to patients this fast onset of clinical responses in ra has been shown in phase 2 clinical trials on otilimab and mavrilimumab nct01023256 and nct01050998 convenience and increased patient compliance given the favorable development profile high affinity excellent pk clean immunogenicity and concentrated formulation exhibited by tjm2 thus far the clinically active dose for tjm2 is expected to be low which is advantageous for chronic maintenance of the disease by subcutaneous administration this provides convenience to the patients and will likely increase patient compliance and analgesic effect on inflammatory pain because the gm csf receptor is also expressed on sensory neurons and is involved in ra associated inflammatory pain gm csf blockade is expected to provide relief for inflammatory pain which provides additional clinical benefits to patients this analgesic effect has been shown in a phase 2 clinical trial on mavrilimumab nct01706926 mechanism of action 151 gm csf is a central driver cytokine in orchestrating an innate immune response during inflammation it is responsible for myeloid cell proliferation and functions such as chemotaxis adhesion phagocytosis and microbial killing importantly gm csf can polarize macrophages into a pro inflammatory m1 phenotype and is known to induce an inflammatory cascade involving other pro inflammatory cytokines such as tnf il 1 il 6 il 12 and il 23 it is evident that gm csf plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and disease progression of multiple autoimmune conditions the action of gm csf is mediated by binding of its cognate receptor on target cells and subsequent phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 147 stat5 148 tjm2 specifically binds to human gm csf with high affinity and can block gm csf from binding to its receptor thereby preventing downstream signaling and target cell activation as a result it can effectively inhibit inflammatory responses mediated by macrophages neutrophils and dendritic cells leading to reduced tissue inflammation and damage table of contents figure role of gm csf in orchestrating coordinated immune response summary of pre clinical results 151 a series of nonclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacology pk and toxicology profiles of tjm2 tjm2 could potently bind to human and monkey gm csf but not rodent gm csf tjm2 neutralized gm csf in a number of pharmacological studies in vitro and in vivo tjm2 demonstrated linear pk behavior in single dose iv and sc studies in monkeys with a half life characteristic of igg and a low ada potential weekly tjm2 treatment significantly reduced arthritis score and clinical symptoms in monkeys with established collagen induced arthritis a model of ra in a glp compliant multilevel four week repeat dose general toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys the no observed adverse effect level 147 noael 148 was considered to be 60 mg kg the nonclinical studies performed to date have demonstrated an acceptable pharmacological profile to allow tjm2 to progress to clinical studies in healthy volunteers pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys the systemic exposure in monkeys after a single iv injection of tjm2 appeared to increase proportionally with doses from 5 25 to 50 mg kg the mean half life t 1 2 was 217 150 241 hours the mean maximum observed concentration c max ranged 112 150 1220 micro g ml and the mean exposure auc 0 last ranged 14800 150 124000 micro g h ml tjm2 also exhibited linear pk behavior following a single subcutaneous 147 sc 148 injection from 5 25 to 50 mg kg with the mean t 1 2 being 215 150 242 hours and the mean bioavailability ranging from 73 to 79 no apparent sex difference was observed the elimination rate of tjm2 was independent of the dose route adas were of low titers and detected only in one animal before dosing and on day 42 post iv dose which did not affect the pk profile ada was clean for the sc administration these results indicate that tjm2 is not a strong immunogen to cynomolgus monkeys pharmacodynamics in cynomolgus monkeys type ii collagen induced arthritis 147 cia 148 is a recognized animal model for ra and drugs approved for ra have shown efficacy in this model monkeys were immunized with collagen to induce the disease once the animals exhibited signs of disease joint swelling weekly injections of vehicle control or 40 mg kg tjm2 were initiated tjm2 significantly decreased the severity of cia as measured by arthritis score over the entire treatment period which correlated with the decrease in stat5 phosphorylation in pbmcs 24

administrations at 20 60 or 200 mg kg the tk parameters were similar following the first and fourth dose indicating no apparent accumulation after repeat administration no apparent sex difference was observed all samples were detected as ada negative throughout the table of contents study period no tjm2 related death or moribund sacrifices occurred possible tjm2 related observation was limited to pulmonary granulomas observed in one male animal given 200 mg kg dose minimal congestion and alveolar protein observed in one male animal given 20 mg kg dose during the recovery period had uncertain

first in human study in healthy volunteers in the united states nct03794180 this study has now been completed with a clinical study report csr available study design this randomized double blind placebo controlled and single dose ascending study was designed to assess the safety tolerability pk pd and immunogenicity of tjm2 referred to as tj003234 in healthy volunteers we have enrolled and completed dosing of four planned cohorts at 0 3 1 3 and 10 mg kg dose levels with each cohort consisting of eight subjects randomized into six receiving tjm2 and two receiving placebo iv infusions safety tjm2 was well tolerated following a single iv dose up to 10 mg kg in healthy subjects with no mtd reached there were no interruptions in dosing or early withdrawals fourteen males and 18 females participated in the study the majority of aes were mild to moderate in nature no serious adverse events were reported during the study overall 8 of the 24 subjects who received tjm2 and 3 of the 8 subjects on placebo reported treatment related treatment emergent adverse events teaes the most common aes experienced by subjects dosed with tjm2 were headache 25 and protein urine 25 these aes were also the most common aes reported by subjects receiving placebo 37 5 and 37 5 respectively pharmacokinetics serum concentrations of tjm2 tj003234 were determined by anti idiotypic antibody capture immunoassay and pk parameters were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis results showed that over the dose range of 0 3 mg kg to 10 mg kg both c max and exposure increased in an approximately dose proportional manner with c max increased from 5 75 micro g ml to 260 micro g ml and auc 0 last increased from 90 5 day micro g ml to 3780 day micro g ml see figure below in addition t 1 2 was approximately 3 weeks across the tested dose range clearance of tjm2 decreased with increasing dose volume of distribution decreased slightly with increasing dose in terms of immunogenicity two

subjects in the 3 mg kg and 10 mg kg cohorts at 4 h to up to 2 weeks after dosing suggesting the saturation of the pstat5 inhibition by the treatment at doses of 3 mg kg and above clinical development plan 151 data from this first in human study support continued development of tjm2 we have received ind approval from the nmpa for a multiple dose phase 1b study in patients with ra to be initiated in the first half of 2020 we also intend to investigate the efficacy of tjm2 in reducing or preventing crs and neurotoxicity associated with car t therapy through collaborations tjc4 a potential highly differentiated cd47 antibody for immuno oncology summary 151 tjc4 is a fully human cd47 monoclonal antibody that we have discovered and developed internally for cancer immunotherapy cd47 has emerged as one of the most promising immuno oncology targets unlike other immuno oncology targets being explored the cd47 sirp 097 pathway is involved in tumor progression by delivering a 147 don 146 t eat me 148 signal to tumor engulfing macrophages thereby protecting tumors from natural attacks by macrophages blockade of this pathway by cd47 antibody represents one of the most effective tumor killing mechanisms however due to the inherent epitope sharing between tumor cells and normal red blood cells 147 rbcs 148 the first wave of clinical stage cd47 antibodies were found in clinical trials to bind to rbcs and cause significant hematologic adverse effects such as severe anemia which has hampered the development of these cd47 antibodies as a potential cancer therapy we developed tjc4 by design to possess a unique property or differentiation to minimize binding to rbcs while retaining anti tumor activities in line with other antibodies of the same class this key differentiation is achieved through additional rbc counter screening to select rare antibody clones that bind to cd47 with high affinity but do not bind to or bind minimally to rbcs the proportion of rbc sparing cd47 antibody leads among all cd47 antibody leads we identified after screening was 0 5 tjc4 has been validated in a series of in vitro and in vivo pre clinical studies which have consistently shown a unique rbc sparing profile comprised of minimal rbc binding lack of hemagglutination and no significant adverse hematologic changes in cynomolgus monkeys even when used at a high dose 100 mg kg our pre clinical data thus far indicate that tjc4 if approved is a potentially highly differentiated anti tumor cd47 antibody with the advantage of minimizing hematologic side effects we have obtained the ind approval from the fda and the nmpa respectively we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in the united states to study the safety profile especially the hematologic profile of tjc4 and to assess its pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and early anti tumor signals in cancer patients we expect to obtain single agent safety data of tjc4 in mid 2020 in parallel we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial of tjc4 in china in patients with aml mds in addition we are collaborating with merck sharp amp dohme corp or msd in a phase 1 clinical trial in the united states for the combination therapy of tjc4 and msd 146 s pd 1 inhibitor keytruda pembrolizumab of multiple types of solid tumors we have not initiated any research and development activities under such collaboration arrangement as of the date of this prospectus therapeutic options and current development 151 we plan to evaluate the therapeutic role of tjc4 in a variety of solid tumors such as cancers of the ovary lung liver pancreas breast and colon and hematological malignancies such as aml mds lymphoblastic leukemia and nhl although pd 1 pd l1 therapies represent a new paradigm in cancer treatment less than 40 of cancer patients have a clinically meaningful response to pd 1 pd l1 treatment as a result targeting other immune components or cells involved in the immune system 146 s anti tumor mechanism has become an area of active pursuit in the field of immuno oncology tjc4 is one such innovative and promising therapeutic antibody which is capable of mobilizing macrophage functions for effective and direct tumor killing currently a number of cd47 antibodies are in clinical development by biotech companies including forty seven inc celgene surface oncology and arch oncology the most advanced asset 5f9 from forty seven inc is in phase 2 clinical studies for multiple cancer indications however almost all clinical trials with cd47 antibodies so far have shown significant hematologic adverse effects likely due to inherent rbc binding properties of generic cd47 antibodies and as a result some clinical studies had to be either terminated or managed with extra cautions table of contents advantages of tjc4 151 tjc4 has similar sub nanomolar binding affinity as other cd47 antibodies and exhibits comparable anti tumor activity the key advantage of tjc4 is its minimal binding to rbcs thus potentially avoiding or minimizing inherent hematologic adverse effects typically seen in other cd47 antibodies in clinical trials this differentiated property of tjc4 is due to its unique epitope interaction as revealed by crystallography which appears different from those recognized by other cd47 antibodies currently in clinical development based on publicly available information the differentiation of tjc4 is highlighted in a series of pre clinical studies summarized as the following i tjc4 displays only minimal rbc binding even at high antibody concentrations by flow cytometry ii tjc4 does not induce rbc agglutination even in a high dose range and iii most importantly tjc4 does not cause significant hematologic changes or systemic toxicologic effects even at high doses in multiple cynomolgus monkey studies including a pivotal 4 week glp toxicity study taken together tjc4 has a potentially better clinical safety profile and may be used in a broader patient population doses to explore its anti tumor potential compared to other clinical stage competitor molecules differentiated product profile of tjc4 sources for comparator antibodies american society of hematology publication plos one publication world intellectual property organization and company data mechanism of action 151 tjc4 blocks the interaction between cd47 expressed on cancer cells and sirp 097 expressed on macrophages leading to increased phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages blockade of cd47 by tjc4 may also promote the development of anti tumor t cell responses resulting from increased tumor antigen presentation by professional antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells in addition to stimulating the phagocytosis of cancer cells cd47 blockade was shown to involve other anti tumor mechanisms such as the enhancement of adcc direct induction of apoptosis programmed cell death of cancer cells induction of differentiation of cancer stem cells and inhibition of metastasis table of contents targeting the cd47 sirp 097 myeloid specific immune checkpoint cd47 is highly expressed on many different types of cancers sirp 097 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on macrophages and other myeloid immune cells when cd47 binds to sirp 097 it causes the inhibition of phagocytosis cd47 antibodies disrupt the cd47 sirp 097 axis and enable the phagocytosis of cancer cells summary of pre clinical results 151 cd47 related in vitro and in vivo anti tumor activities tjc4 exhibits high affinity binding to human cd47 protein and cd47 expressing tumor cells at the nanomolar level and effectively blocks interaction of cd47 with its receptor sirp 097 as compared with other cd47 antibodies currently under clinical development tjc4 demonstrated comparable potency in the enhanced macrophage mediated phagocytosis of raji tumor cells see figure a below and comparable anti tumor activity in the hl 60 leukemia and raji xenograft models see figure b below moreover when combined

presence of the test antibodies normalized to that of igg control table of contents thirdly in vivo safety studies were performed in cynomolgus monkeys to assess the effects of tjc4 on the hematology parameters whereas a single bolus iv injection of the comparator antibody caused a significant drop in the number of rbcs and hemoglobin 147 hgb 148 levels treatment with tjc4 at a dose of 10 mg kg did not significantly affect the number of rbcs hgb levels or reticulocyte or platelet counts see figure below hematological parameters in non human primates treated with a single dose of cd47 antibodies on day 0 naive cynomolgus monkeys were iv injected with pbs control n 2 tjc4 n 2 10 mg kg or a comparator antibody n 2 10 mg kg blood cells were counted twice before drug injection baseline and at 3 6 10 14 and 21 days post injection moreover in a four week glp toxicology study tjc4 treatment did not induce significant overall toxicologic changes only mild decreases in the number of rbcs hgb and hematocrit were found which reached nadir at day 4 post first administration and then gradually recovered to the normal range following administration the changes were not dose dependent compared with the placebo control the average decrease of rbcs in the treated animals was approximately 6 to 9 with only one animal showing an 18 drop at a dose of 30 mg kg no rbc associated changes were noted in histopathologic examinations or in bone marrow smears including erythrocytic series therefore noael was defined at 100 mg kg four week glp toxicology study in monkeys no anemia in non human primates male at a high dose range key preclinical data from above have been published as a poster presentation 4063 at american society of hematology 2019 annual table of contents clinical development plan 151 we have recently initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced cancer in the united states the clinical trial nct03934814 is designed to assess the safety of tjc4 in particular the hematologic safety profile including changes in hemoglobin levels and rbc counts the clinical trial includes typical dose escalation schemes up to 30 mg kg and cohort expansions in cancer patients we expected to obtain single agent safety data of tjc4 in mid 2020 in the same clinical trial we also intend to evaluate the pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy signals of tjc4 as a single agent and in combination with a pd 1 inhibitor or rituximab in patients with advanced solid tumors and relapsed or refractory lymphoma the first cohort of four patients has been enrolled and dosed at 1 mg kg preliminary data showed that the average reduction in hemoglobin levels after treatment was less than 10 in parallel we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial of tjc4 in china in patients with aml mds in addition we are collaborating with merck sharp amp dohme corp or msd in the same phase 1 clinical trial in the united states for the combination therapy of tjc4 and msd 146 s pd 1 inhibitor keytruda pembrolizumab under a collaboration agreement in cancer patients with several types of solid tumors after completing a single agent dose escalation we have not initiated any research and development activities under such collaboration arrangement as of the date of this prospectus the goals of our global and china clinical development plans are to i advance clinical development of tjc4 in hematologic malignancies towards registration and ii explore tjc4 146 s treatment efficacy in various solid tumors in combination with pd 1 therapies including but not limited to ovarian cancer gastric cancer hepatocellular carcinoma renal cell carcinoma nsclc and urothelial carcinoma in which cd47 is highly expressed tjd5 a potential highly differentiated cd73 antibody for cancer treatment summary 151 tjd5 is an internally developed humanized inhibitory antibody against human cd73 cd73 is a homodimeric enzyme expressed in tumors and plays a critical role in suppressing immune cells in tumor micro environment tjd5 displays sub nanomolar binding affinity to cd73 and inhibits its nucleotidase activity in vitro tjd5 completely reversed the amp or tumor cell mediated suppression of t cells in vivo when combined with a pd l1 antibody tjd5 exhibited a superior or synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor growth the key differentiation of tjd5 when compared to some of the other clinical stage antibodies of the same class is related to its novel epitope which works through a unique intra dimer binding mode resulting in a complete inhibition of the enzymatic activity and avoiding the aberrant pharmacological property known as the 147 hook effect 148 with this particular mode of action tjd5 if approved has the potential to become a highly differentiated cd73 antibody we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in cancer patients in partnership with tracon pharmaceuticals in the united states safety data from dose escalation cohorts of tjd5 in combination with atezolizumab a pd l1 inhibitor provided by roche under a clinical supply agreement among roche tracon and us are expected in 2020 we obtained ind approval from the nmpa for tjd5 in september 2019 in china we will collaborate with shanghai junshi biosciences co ltd or junshi for the combination therapy of tjd5 with junshi 146 s pd 1 monoclonal antibody toripalimab in cancer patients with various types of solid tumors we have not initiated any research and development activities under such collaboration arrangement as of the date of this prospectus therapeutic options and current development 151 despite recent breakthroughs with pd 1 pd l1 therapies clinical non response rates to such treatments remains high in cancer patients exceeding 60 this non responsiveness to these standard treatments is partly due to the fact that t cells within an inhibitory tumor environment are suppressed and fail to respond to stimulation induced by pd 1 pd l1 therapies cd73 which converts extracellular adenosine monophosphate 147 amp 148 to adenosine is implicated in one of the protective mechanisms of tumors that evade immune attack by creating an adenosine rich microenvironment inhibitory to immune cells pre clinical studies have indicated that the inhibition of cd73 renders t cells more responsive to pd 1 pd l1 therapies by altering the tumor micro environment resulting in a superior anti tumor effect as cd73 is widely expressed in various cancers a combination therapy of tjd5 with a pd 1 pd l1 antibody may increase the likelihood of treatment success in cancer patients who do not respond to standard pd 1 pd l1 therapies the potential cancer indications of tjd5 include thyroid cancer lung cancer colorectal cancer stomach cancer urothelial cancer endometrial cancer head and neck cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer and melanoma in which cd73 is widely expressed a number of global companies are running active clinical development programs with cd73 antibodies medi 9447 from medimmune and bms 986179 from bristol myers squibb are the two most advanced cd73 antibodies which table of contents are in phase 1 2 clinical trials bms 986179 is being studied as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab a pd 1 antibody for the treatment of advanced colorectal esophageal gastric ovarian and pancreatic cancers medimmune is testing medi 9447 for the treatment of solid tumors as a single agent or in combination with durvalumab a pd l1 antibody or chemotherapy nzv 930 from novartis and cpi 006 from corvus have entered phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors advantages of tjd5 151 extracellular amp can be generated from atp cyclic amp and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 147 nad 148 through separate biochemical pathways all of which converge to cd73 to generate adenosine thus cd73 antibody is expected to block adenosine generation more completely than other related targets further cd73 antibody works through a substrate non competitive fashion and has advantages over small molecule inhibitors targeting the adenosine pathway through a substrate competing fashion more importantly tjd5 if approved is potentially highly differentiated among the clinical stage cd73 antibodies as it binds to a novel epitope in the c terminal domain of cd73 without causing a 147 hook effect 148 tjd5 has the following key advantages i tjd5 exhibits a typical dose response curve without the 147 hook effect 148 and with a complete inhibition of both soluble and surface bound cd73 and ii tjd5 has a non competitive inhibitory effect that is not blunted by high levels of cd73 enzyme substrates which would be expected for small molecule competitive blockers these pharmacological properties may translate into efficient target inhibition in tumors and superior anti tumor activity especially in an adenosine rich micro environment mechanism of action 151 adenosine is a potent immunosuppressive signaling molecule abundant in the tumor microenvironment cd73 is the rate limiting enzyme that generates adenosine from extracellular amp tjd5 allosterically inhibits the cd73 enzyme by preventing the inactive cd73 dimer from changing into the active conformation in a substrate non competitive manner this results in a decrease in adenosine production in the tumor micro environment increasing t cell anti tumor activity schematic diagram of cd73 catalyzed adenosine ado generation and immunosuppression by ado in the tumor microenvironment summary of pre clinical results 151 inhibition of cd73 by tjd5 as shown in the figure below tjd5 displayed complete inhibition of soluble cd73 enzymatic activity ic 50 0 22 n m without the 147 hook effect 148 in contrast to the comparator molecule which at higher concentrations caused a paradoxical rebound of enzymatic activity presumably due to its inter dimer binding mode table of contents figure inhibition of soluble cd73 enzymatic activity by cd73 antibodies restoration of t cell activity by tjd5 in vitro we observed that amp inhibited interferon gamma ifn 103 production by cd4 or cd8 t cells through adenosine generation mimicking the suppressive tumor microenvironment where amp is abundantly produced however this suppression could be reversed by tjd5 in a concentration dependent manner moreover in an experimental system where cd73 high human ovarian cell line sk ov 3 and human t cells were co cultured addition of tjd5 restored t cell activity as measured by ifn 103 production in a concentration dependent manner in vivo anti tumor activity of tjd5 tjd5 monotherapy showed a moderate anti tumor effect in a mouse xenograft model bearing a375 melanoma cells to examine whether tjd5 can enhance the anti tumor activity of the pd l1 antibody we evaluated the therapeutic effects of tjd5 used as a single agent and in combination with a pd l1 antibody in the same a375 melanoma model the combination treatment group resulted in 68 inhibition of tumor growth which is significantly better than the vehicle and tjd5 monotherapy in vivo anti tumor activity of tjd5 and anti pd l1 in a375 melanoma xenograft model mice were treated with pbs control anti pd l1 10 mg kg tjd5 5 mg kg or a combination of anti pd l1 and tjd5 twice a week for three weeks tumor volumes as percentages relative to baseline day 0 for each treated group n 7 per group left and for each individual mouse right were plotted pharmacokinetics of tjd5 in cynomolgus monkeys following a single iv injection of tjd5 at 5 25

micro g ml mean half life was 44 9 hours 61 5 hours and 104 hours respectively reflecting decreased clearance of tjd5 with increasing dose no apparent sex difference was observed in the main pk parameters positive adas against tjd5 were detected in the majority of the animals without an apparent impact on systemic exposure table of contents figure concentration time profile of tjd5 in cynomolgus monkeys repeat dose toxicology study of tjd5 in cynomolgus monkeys a four week glp toxicity study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys followed by a six week recovery period to evaluate the potential toxicity of tjd5 forty cynomolgus monkeys were randomly assigned into four groups 5 sex group and given five weekly doses of tjd5 at 20 60 or 200 mg kg via iv injection systemic exposures cmax and auc 0 t generally increased dose proportionately and the day 22 values were generally higher than those on day 1 with mean accumulation ratios ar ranging between 1 65 and 2 19 no apparent sex difference was observed positive tjd5 antibodies were detected in the majority of animals following repeat administration at all doses while no significant impact was observed on the tk profiles the only tjd5 related effect was decreased monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp 1 on day 1 24 or 48 hours post dosing in treated animals due to a lack of corresponding findings or impact on the well being of the animals this effect was not considered adverse no abnormality was observed in other study endpoints including safety pharmacology parameters and immunotoxicity the no observed adverse effect level noael was defined at 200 mg kg this dose level corresponded to the mean c max and auc values of 6890 micro g ml and 594000 micro g hr ml in males respectively and 6450 micro g ml and 501000 micro g hr ml in females respectively on day 22 of the dosing phase clinical development plan 151 the current clinical development plan is to develop tjd5 in the united states and china in parallel in the united states we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial of tjd5 in combination with atezolizumab a pd l1 inhibitor provided by roche under a clinical supply agreement among roche tracon and us in patients with advanced solid tumors in partnership with tracon pharmaceuticals inc which will be responsible for conducting the current phase 1 clinical trial in the united states tjd5 is referred to as tj004309 nct03835949 seven patients have been dosed so far safety data of tjd5 from dose escalation cohorts are expected in 2020 in china we have obtained the ind approval from nmpa and plan to begin a clinical trial to evaluate the safety tolerability pk pd and potential efficacy primarily in patients with solid tumors including lung cancer we are collaborating with shanghai junshi biosciences co ltd or junshi for the combination therapy of tjd5 with junshi 146 s pd 1 monoclonal antibody toripalimab in cancer patients with various types of solid tumors we have not initiated any research and development activities under such collaboration arrangement as of the date of this prospectus pre clinical assets monoclonal antibodies tj210 and tjx7 are monoclonal antibodies currently at the cmc stage moving towards ind submission in the united states by 2020 tj210 a potential highly differentiated antibody targeting myeloid derived suppressor cells in cancers and autoimmune diseases 151 tj210 is a fully human high affinity antibody against human c5ar1 for the treatment of cancers and potentially autoimmune diseases tumors produce large amounts of complement factor c5a to attract c5ar1 expressing myeloid derived suppressor cells 147 mdscs 148 m2 macrophages and neutrophils these myeloid cells critically contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment as part of the evading mechanism of tumors and are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to pd 1 pd l1 therapies in many cancers inhibition of c5a or its table of contents receptor c5ar in mice leads to markedly reduced mdscs and has an inhibitory effect on tumor growth in various tumor bearing animal models the c5ar blocking antibody has been shown to have significant therapeutic activity when combined with pd 1 therapies in pd 1 resistant tumor models tj210 exerts strong anti tumor activity by blocking the activation and migration of c5ar1 expressing myeloid cells and has a highly differentiated potential if approved as it binds to a novel epitope and possesses superior functional properties compared to the only competitor antibody from innate pharma tj210 shows a more potent anti tumor effect especially when c5a concentrations are high and binds to c5a receptors in both humans and monkeys making pre clinical safety assessment possible in addition tj210 has therapeutic potential in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune indications in which the role of the c5a c5ar axis has been validated we partnered with the original developer of tj210 morphosys for greater china rights and shared global rights tj210 is progressing towards ind submission by 2020 in the united states and we plan to work jointly with morphosys to develop this asset tjx7 a novel cxcl13 antibody for autoimmune diseases 151 tjx7 is an internally discovered novel humanized neutralizing antibody targeting the cxcl13 chemokine cxcl13 through its receptor cxcr5 plays a key role in forming germinal centers which are critical for immune response the role of cxcl13 in forming germinal centers is to guide the migration of germinal center b cells and follicular t cells within the lymphoid organs and facilitate their interaction maturation and function one of the key pathogenic features in autoimmune diseases is related to the aberrant formation of ectopic germinal centers formed in affected organs contributing to chronic inflammation and tissue destruction elevated serum cxcl13 levels cxcr5 expressing t cells and pathogenic germinal center b cells and even ectopic germinal center formation are found in multiple autoimmune diseases including sj ouml gren 146 s syndrome ra multiple sclerosis and sle tjx7 is being developed for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and has been shown to bind to cxcl13 with sub nanomolar affinity effectively blocking the interaction between cxcl13 and cxcr5 and the downstream signaling tjx7 has been shown to completely inhibit the migration of primary human tonsil b cells pharmacodynamic studies in mice and cynomolgus monkeys have confirmed tjx7 146 s inhibitory effects on germinal center formation and antibody production results generated so far indicate that tjx7 may provide a new therapeutic angle in the treatment of autoimmune diseases as it acts uniquely at the core of tissue pathologies tjx7 is currently under cmc and pre clinical development pre clinical assets bi specific antibody panel pd l1 based bi specific antibodies as previously discussed this panel of pd l1 based bi specific antibodies is designed according to the scientific rationale that a pd l1 antibody when engineered with a selected second immune component such as a cytokine or another antibody is able to convert 147 cold tumors 148 which typically do not respond to pd 1 pd l1 inhibitors to 147 hot tumors 148 which are more sensitive to pd 1 pd l1 therapies such pd l1 based bi specific antibodies are expected to increase the probability of treatment success in patients who do not respond to pd 1 pd l1 treatment based on this concept we have generated a panel of bi specific antibodies using our proprietary pd l1 antibody sequence as the backbone the first signal linked to a second component the second signal of selected immune properties the second signals for this panel of bi specific antibodies include il 7 cytokine expanding t effector cells 4 1bb and b7 h3 antibodies activating t cells synergistically with pd l1 and cd47 antibody adding the macrophage killing mechanism we strive to validate all bi specific antibodies through a series of robust in vitro and in vivo studies for proof of concept thus providing a solid basis for further development collectively we have demonstrated that the second paired component must be structurally integrated with the tumor engaging anti pd l1 backbone to concentrate and function effectively inside tumors which cannot be achieved by simply combining two free agents 147 fortified 148 bi specific antibodies for specific cancer therapeutic purposes tj c4gm is a 147 fortified 148 version of the cd47 antibody which is specifically designed for the treatment of solid tumors through the cd47 mediated macrophage killing mechanism as the majority of tumor associated macrophages adopt an anti inflammatory and tumor promoting m2 phenotype rather than a pro inflammatory m1 phenotype they are less efficient in phagocytosis in response to cd47 blockade thus treatment of solid tumors with the cd47 antibody may exhibit limited efficacy tj c4gm is a novel molecule composed of tjc4 with an engineered gm csf moiety fused at the c terminus of the antibody heavy chain gm csf is a potent cytokine known to convert tumor resident m2 macrophages into tumor engulfing m1 macrophages which enables tj c4gm to exert a better phagocytic effect in solid tumors these unique functional properties of tj c4gm are confirmed in a series of in vitro and in vivo tumor animal models in table of contents which tj c4gm exerts superior anti tumor activity against solid tumors which cannot be achieved by tjc4 or gm csf used either alone or in combination tj c4gm is currently at the cmc and pre clinical development stage tj cldn4b is a bi specific antibody targeting both claudin18 2 cldn18 2 a tumor antigen preferentially expressed in gastric and pancreatic cancers and 4 1bb a co stimulatory molecule on t cells cldn18 2 is a tight junction molecule normally expressed only on epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa which is inaccessible by antibodies under normal conditions making it a highly attractive tumor target although a cldn18 2 monoclonal antibody claudiximab was active in a phase 2 trial only the cldn18 2 high expressing tumors seemed to be susceptible in collaboration with abl bio we developed a bi specific antibody tj cldn4b which provides two key advantages over current cldn18 2 antibodies and 4 1bb agonistic antibodies first tj cldn4b is capable of binding to tumor cells even with low levels of cldn18 2 expression making it more suitable for a broader patient population second only upon tumor cell engagement by tj cldn4b are t cells activated in contrast other pan activating 4 1bb antibodies that activate t cells regardless of tumor engagement are prone to liver toxicity as seen in clinical studies in a humanized mouse model tj cldn4b suppressed tumor growth to a greater extent than anti cldn18 2 or anti 4 1bb alone or in combination tj cldn4b is currently at the cmc and pre clinical development stage licensing and

drug registration applications are divided into three different types namely new drug application generic drug application and imported drug application drugs are categorized based on their working mechanism including chemical medicine biological product or traditional chinese or natural medicine as provided in the administrative measures for drug registration the drug administration law and implementing measures of the drug administration law upon completion of non clinical research clinical trials shall be conducted for the application of new drug registration upon approval from nmpa or authorized institutions prior to engaging with the nmpa on research and development approval an applicant shall determine the registration category for its drug candidate subject to ultimate confirmation by the nmpa which will determine the requirements for its clinical trial and marketing application there are five categories for small molecule drugs category 1 147 innovative drugs 148 refers to drugs with a new chemical entity that have not been marketed anywhere in the world category 2 147 improved new drugs 148 refers to drugs with a new indication dosage form route of administration combination or certain formulation changes not previously approved anywhere in the world categories 3 and 4 refer to generic drugs that reference an innovator drug or certain well known generic drugs marketed either abroad or in china respectively and category 5 refers to innovative or generic drugs that have already been marketed abroad but are not yet approved in china i e various imported drugs approval 151 all clinical trials conducted in china for new drug development must be approved and conducted at pharmaceutical clinical trial institution which shall be under filing administration for imported drugs proof of foreign approval is required prior to the trial unless the drug has never been approved anywhere in the world in addition to a standalone trial in china imported drug applicants may establish a site in china as part of an international multi center trial the 147 imct 148 at the outset of the global trial domestically manufactured drugs are not subject to foreign approval requirements and by contrast to prior practice the nmpa has recently decided to also permit such drugs to be tested and developed through an imct in addition the nmpa has adopted a notification system for clinical trials of new drugs pursuant to the opinions on deepening the reform of the evaluation and approval systems and encouraging innovation on drugs and medical devices the 147 innovation opinion 148 and the announcement on adjusting the evaluation and approval procedure of drug clinical trial clinical trials may be commenced as long as the applicant has not received any objections from the cde within 60 business days of application filing as opposed to the lengthier prior clinical trial pre approval process in which an affirmative approval from the nmpa must be obtained to commence clinical trials the number of trial sites in china may increase due to the shortening of the accreditation timeline resulting from the replacement of the pre approval procedure with the notification procedure drug clinical trial registration pursuant to the administrative measures for drug registration upon obtaining the clinical trial approval and before commencing a clinical trial the applicant shall file a registration with the nmpa containing various details of the clinical trial including the clinical study protocol the name of the principal researcher of the leading institution names of participating institutions and researchers an approval letter from the ethics committee and a sample of the informed consent form with a copy sent to the competent

guidance principles the data of foreign clinical trials must meet the authenticity completeness accuracy and traceability requirements and such data must be obtained in consistency with the relevant requirements under the good clinical trial practice gcp of the international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use the 147 ich 148 clinical trial sponsors must be attentive to potentially meaningful ethnic differences in the subject population the nmpa now officially permits and its predecessor agencies have permitted on a case by case basis in the past drugs approved outside of china to be approved in china on a conditional basis without pre approval clinical trials being conducted in china specifically in 2018 the nmpa issued the procedures for reviewing and approval of clinical urgently needed overseas new drugs permitting drugs that have been approved within the last ten years in the united states the european union or japan and that prevent or treat orphan diseases or prevent or treat serious life threatening illnesses for which there is either no effective therapy in china or for which the foreign approved drug would have clear clinical advantages applicants will be required to establish a risk mitigation plan and may be required to complete trials in china after the drug has been marketed the cde has developed a list of qualifying drugs that meet the foregoing criteria clinical trial process and good clinical practices 151 typically drug clinical trials in china have four phases phase 1 refers to the initial clinical pharmacology and human safety evaluation studies phase 2 refers to the preliminary evaluation of a drug candidate 146 s therapeutic efficacy and safety for target indication s in patients phase 3 often the pivotal study refers to clinical trials that further verify the drug candidate 146 s therapeutic efficacy and safety on patients with target indication s and ultimately provide sufficient evidence for the review of a drug registration application phase 4 refers to a new drug 146 s post marketing study to assess therapeutic effectiveness and adverse reactions when the drug is widely used to evaluate overall benefit risk relationships of the drug when used among the general population or specific groups and to adjust the administration dose etc on august 6 2003 the nmpa promulgated the administration of quality of drug clinical practice the 147 gcp 148 to improve the quality of clinical trials pursuant to the newly amended drug administrative law and the regulations on the administration of drug clinical trial institution jointly promulgated by nmpa and nhc on november 29 2019 and effective from december 1 2019 drug clinical trial

accelerate the new drug approval process in china manufacturing and distribution according to the drug administration law all facilities that manufacture drugs in china must receive a drug manufacturing license from the local drug regulatory authority each drug manufacturing license issued to a pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprise is effective for a period of five years any enterprise holding a drug manufacturing license is subject to review by the relevant regulatory authorities on an annual basis a separate certification of compliance with good manufacturing practice the 147 gmp 148 is also required similarly to conduct sales importation shipping and storage collectively the 147 distribution activities 148 a company must obtain a drug distribution license from the

implemented a 147 two invoice system 148 to control the distribution of prescription drugs the 147 two invoice system 148 generally requires that no more than two invoices be issued throughout the distribution chain one from the manufacturer to a distributor and another from the distributor to the end user hospital this excludes the sale of products invoiced from the manufacturer to its wholly owned or controlled distributors or for imported drugs to its exclusive distributor or from a distributor to its wholly owned or controlled subsidiary or between its wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries however the system still significantly limits the options for companies to use multiple distributors to reach a larger geographic area in china compliance with the two invoice system is a prerequisite for pharmaceutical companies to participate in the procurement processes of public hospitals which currently provide most of china 146 s healthcare services manufacturers and distributors that fail to implement the two invoice system may lose their qualifications to participate in the bidding process non compliant manufacturers may also be blacklisted from engaging in drug sales to

industrial application under the prc patent law the term of patent protection starts from the date of application patents relating to invention are effective for twenty years and utility models and designs are effective for ten years from the date of application the prc patent law adopts the principle of 147 first to file 148 system which provides that where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention a patent will be granted to the person who files the application first existing patents can become narrowed invalid or unenforceable due to a variety of grounds including lack of novelty creativity and deficiencies in patent application in china a patent must have novelty creativity and practical applicability under the prc patent law novelty means that before a patent application is filed no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in china or overseas or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means whether in or outside of china nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is recorded in patent application documents or patent documents published after the filing date creativity means that compared with existing technology an invention has prominent substantial features and represents notable progress and a utility model has substantial features and represents any progress practical applicability means an invention or utility model can be manufactured or used and may produce positive results patents in china are filed with the state intellectual property office the 147 sipo 148 normally the sipo publishes an application for an invention patent within 18 months after the filing date which may be shortened at the request of applicant the applicant must apply to the sipo for a substantive examination within three years from the date of application table of contents article 20 of the prc patent law provides that for an invention or utility model completed in china any applicant not just chinese companies and individuals before filing a patent application outside of china must first submit it to the sipo for a confidential examination failure to comply with this requirement will result in the denial of any chinese patent for the relevant invention this added requirement of confidential examination by the sipo has raised concerns by foreign companies who conduct research and development activities in china or outsource research and development activities to service providers in china patent enforcement unauthorized use of patents without consent from owners of patents forgery of the patents belonging to other persons or engagement in other patent infringement acts will subject the infringers to infringement liability serious offenses such as forgery of patents may be subject to criminal penalties when a dispute arises out of infringement of the patent owner 146 s patent right chinese law requires that the parties first attempt to settle the dispute through mutual consultation however if the dispute cannot be settled through mutual consultation the patent owner or an interested party who believes the patent is being infringed may either file a civil legal suit or file an administrative complaint with the relevant patent administration authority a chinese court may issue a preliminary injunction upon the patent owner 146 s or an interested party 146 s request before instituting any legal proceedings or during the proceedings damages for infringement are calculated as the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement and if the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement cannot be determined the damages for infringement shall be calculated as the benefit gained by the infringer from the infringement if it is difficult to ascertain damages in this manner damages may be determined by using a reasonable multiple of the license fee under a contractual license statutory damages may be awarded in the circumstances where the damages cannot be determined by the above

provided in the notice on the relevant operating issues concerning the improvement of the administration of payment and settlement of foreign currency capital of foreign funded enterprises on june 9 2016 the safe issued the circular on the reform and standardization of the management policy of the settlement of capital projects under the circular on the reform and standardization of the management policy of the settlement of capital projects and the circular on the reform of the management method for the settlement of foreign exchange capital of foreign invested enterprises the settlement of foreign exchange by foreign invested enterprises shall be governed by the policy of foreign exchange settlement on a discretionary basis however the aforementioned circulars also reiterate that the settlement of foreign exchange shall only be used for its own operation purposes within the business scope of the foreign invested enterprises and following the principles of authenticity considering that these circulars are relatively new it is unclear how they will be implemented and there exist great uncertainties with respect to their interpretation and implementation by the authorities the safe promulgated the circular on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange control on domestic residents 146 offshore investment and financing and roundtrip investment through special purpose vehicles on july 4 2014 which requires prc residents to register with local branches of the safe in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity for the purpose of overseas investment and financing with such prc residents 146 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests as a 147 special purpose vehicle 148 as defined therein the aforesaid circular further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle failure to comply with the safe registration requirements under the circular on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange control on domestic residents 146 offshore investment and financing and roundtrip investment through special purpose vehicles could result in liabilities under prc law for evasion of foreign exchange controls the circular on further simplifying and improving foreign exchange administration policies in respect of direct investment provides that local banks instead of the safe can directly handle the initial foreign exchange registration and amendment registration under the circular on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange control on domestic residents 146 offshore investment and financing and roundtrip investment through special purpose vehicles dividend distribution pursuant to the prc company law the wholly foreign owned enterprise law of the prc and the detailed implementing rules for the wholly foreign owned enterprise law of the people 146 s republic china foreign invested enterprises in the prc may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations in addition a foreign invested enterprise is required to set aside at least 10 of its accumulated profits each year to fund certain reserve funds until the accumulative amount of such fund reaches 50 of its registered capital these wholly foreign owned companies may also allocate a portion of their after tax profits based on prc accounting standards to employee welfare and bonus funds amounts allocated to these reserve funds and employee welfare and bonus funds reduce the amount distributable as cash dividends upon approval of the competent governmental authorities foreign investors may utilize rmb dividends to invest or re invest in enterprises established in china on january 26 2017 the safe issued the notice on improving the check of authenticity and compliance to further promote foreign exchange control which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to outbound remittance of profits from domestic entities to offshore entities including the following i under the principle of genuine transaction banks shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution the original version of tax filing records and audited financial statements and ii domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years 146 losses before remitting the profits moreover domestic entities shall provide detailed explanations table of contents of the sources of capital and the utilization arrangements and board resolutions contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment regulations relating to labor labor law and labor contract law pursuant to the prc labor law promulgated by the standing committee of the npc on july 5 1994 and effective from january 1 1995 and amended on august 27 2009 and december 29 2018 respectively the prc labor contract law promulgated by the standing committee of the npc on june 29 2007 and effective from january 1 2008 and amended on december 28 2012 and effective from july

rules and standards provide education regarding labor safety and sanitation to its employees provide employees with labor safety and sanitary conditions and necessary protection materials in compliance with the state rules and standards and carry out regular health examinations for employees engaged in work involving occupational hazards social insurance and housing provident funds under applicable prc laws including the social insurance law of the prc which became effective on july 1 2011 and was amended on december 19 2018 the interim regulations on the collection and payment of social security funds promulgated by the state council on january 22 1999 and amended on march 24 2019 and the regulations on the administration of housing provident funds promulgated by the state council on april 3 1999 and amended on march 24 2002 and march 24 2019 respectively employers are required to contribute on behalf of their employees to a number of social security funds including funds for basic pension insurance unemployment insurance basic medical insurance occupational injury insurance maternity insurance and housing provident funds these payments are made to local administrative authorities and any employer who fails to contribute may be fined and ordered to pay the deficit amount within a stipulated time limit regulations relating to enterprise income tax pursuant to the enterprise income tax law of the prc effective as of january 1 2008 and as amended on february 24 2017 and december 29 2018 respectively the income tax rate for both domestic and foreign invested enterprises is 25 with certain exceptions to clarify certain provisions in the enterprise income tax law the state council promulgated the implementation rules of the enterprise income tax law on december 6 2007 which was amended and became effective on april 23 2019 under the enterprise income tax law and the implementation rules of the enterprise income tax law enterprises are classified as either 147 resident enterprises 148 or 147 non resident enterprises 148 besides enterprises established within the prc enterprises established outside of china whose 147 de facto management bodies 148 are located in china are considered 147 resident enterprises 148 and subject to the uniform 25 enterprise income tax rate for their global income in addition the enterprise income tax law provides that a non resident enterprise refers to an entity established under foreign law whose 147 de facto management bodies 148 are not within the prc but has an establishment or place of business in the prc or does not have an establishment or place of business in the prc but has income sourced within the prc the implementation rules of the enterprise income tax law provide that since january 1 2008 an income tax rate of 10 shall normally be applicable to dividends declared to non prc resident enterprise investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in the prc or have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the prc the income tax on the dividends may be reduced pursuant to a tax treaty between china and the jurisdictions in which the non prc shareholders reside other prc national and provincial level laws and regulations we are subject to changing regulations under many other laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities at the national provincial and municipal levels some of which are or may become applicable to our business for example regulations control the confidentiality of patients 146 medical information and the circumstances under which patient medical information may be released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties these laws and regulations governing both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information may become more restrictive in the future table of contents we also comply with numerous additional national and provincial laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions manufacturing practices environmental protection and fire hazard control we believe that we are currently in compliance with these laws and regulations however we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition u s regulation government regulation and product approval in the united states the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states at federal state and local levels as well as in foreign countries extensively regulate among other things the research development testing manufacture quality control import export safety effectiveness labeling packaging storage distribution recordkeeping approval advertising promotion marketing post approval monitoring and post approval reporting of biological products along with third party contractors we will be required to navigate the various pre clinical clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our drug candidates the processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions along with subsequent compliance with applicable laws and regulations and other regulatory authorities require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources government policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay further development or regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates or anticipated manufacturing processes disease indications or labeling we cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action review and approval for licensing biologics in the united states in the united states the fda regulates our current drug candidates as biological products or biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the 147 fdca 148 the public health service act and associated implementing regulations biologics like other drugs are used for the treatment prevention or cure of disease in humans in contrast to chemically synthesized small molecular weight drugs which have a well defined structure and can be thoroughly characterized biologics are generally derived from living material human animal or microorganism and are complex in structure and thus are usually not fully characterized biologics include immunomedicines for cancer and other diseases biologics are also subject to other federal state and local statutes and regulations the failure to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or after approval may subject a sponsor or applicant to administrative or judicial enforcement actions these actions could include the suspension or termination of clinical trials by the fda the fda 146 s refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications withdrawal of an approval 147 warning letters 148 official messages from the fda to a manufacturer or other organization that it has violated some rule in a federally regulated activity or 147 untitled letters 148 initial correspondences from the fda with a regulated industry that cite violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance for a warning letter and request correction of the violation product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution import detention injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the fda the department of justice the 147 doj 148 or other governmental entities an applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a biologic in the united states typically must undertake the following completion of non clinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the fda 146 s good laboratory practice the 147 glp 148 regulations submission to the fda of an application for an investigational new drug 147 ind 148 which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made manufacture labeling and distribution of an investigational drug in compliance with current good manufacturing practice the 147 cgmp 148 table of contents approval by an independent institutional review board the 147 irb 148 or ethics committee at each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated performance

user fee act the 147 pdufa 148 for the relevant year obtaining fda review and approval of the bla to permit commercial marketing of the licensed biologic for particular indications for use in the united states and compliance with any post approval requirements including the potential requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy the 147 rems 148 and the potential requirement to conduct post approval studies the testing and approval process requires substantial time effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis if at all from time to time legislation is drafted introduced and passed in the congress of the united states that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing approval manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the fda in addition to new legislation fda regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our drug candidates it is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether fda regulations guidance policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes if any may be pre clinical and clinical development in the united states before a bla applicant can begin testing the potential asset in human subjects the applicant must first conduct pre clinical studies pre clinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry toxicity and formulation as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the biologic for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use pre clinical studies are subject to federal regulations and requirements including glp regulations the results of an applicant 146 s pre clinical studies are submitted to the fda as part of an ind an ind is a request for authorization from the fda to administer an investigational new drug product to humans an ind is an exemption from the fdca that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment in support of a request for an ind applicants must submit a range of information including pre clinical data manufacturing information and a detailed protocol for each clinical trial any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind human clinical trials may not begin until an ind is effective the ind automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the fda unless the fda raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial within the 30 day time period in such a case the ind may be placed on clinical hold and the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin submission of an ind therefore may or may not result in fda authorization to begin a clinical trial the fda may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on such trial following commencement of a clinical trial under an ind a clinical hold is an order issued by the fda to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical table of contents investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation a partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the ind for example a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed while other protocols may do so no more than 30 days after the imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold the fda will provide the sponsor with a written explanation of the basis for the hold following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold an investigation may only resume after the fda has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed the fda will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the fda that the investigation can proceed clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cgcp regulations which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing among other things the objectives of the study the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated a separate submission to the existing ind must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments a sponsor may choose but is not required to conduct a foreign clinical study under an ind when a foreign clinical study is conducted under an ind all fda ind requirements must be met unless waived when the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an ind the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with cgcp regulations in order to use the study as support for an ind or application for marketing approval including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from subjects furthermore an independent irb for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed regulatory authorities the irb or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor known as a data safety monitoring board the 147 dsmb 148 dsmbs provide authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if a dsmb determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or based on other grounds such as no demonstration of efficacy other grounds for suspension or termination may be made based on evolving business objectives and or competitive climate there are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries clinical trials for purposes of bla approval clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases that may overlap or be combined phase 1 the investigational product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition these trials are designed to test the safety dosage tolerance absorption metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans and the side effects associated with increasing doses these trials may also yield early evidence of effectiveness in the case of some products for severe or life threatening diseases especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic the initial human testing may be conducted in phase 2 the investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks multiple phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive phase 3 clinical trials phase 3 the investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate dosage to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety these clinical trials are intended to generate sufficient data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the fda table of contents in some cases the fda may require or companies may voluntarily pursue additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product referred to as phase 4 trials such post approval trials when applicable are conducted following initial approval typically to develop additional data and information relating to the biological characteristics of the product and treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the fda and more frequently if serious adverse events occur in addition ind safety reports must be submitted to the fda for any of the following suspected serious and unexpected adverse reactions findings from epidemiological studies pooled analysis of multiple studies animal or in vitro testing or other clinical studies whether or not conducted under an ind and whether or not conducted by the sponsor that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over such rate listed in the protocol or investigator brochure which is a comprehensive document summarizing the body of information about an investigational product obtained during clinical and non clinical trials each of phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period or at all furthermore the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk similarly an irb can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution or an institution it represents if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the irb 146 s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients the fda will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cgcp and the integrity of the clinical data submitted during clinical development the sponsor often refines the indication and endpoints on which the bla will be based for endpoints based on patient reported outcomes the 147 pros 148 and observer reported outcomes the 147 oros 148 the process typically is an iterative one the fda has issued guidance on the framework it uses to evaluate pro instruments although the agency may offer advice on optimizing pro and oro instruments during the clinical development process the fda usually reserves final judgment until it reviews the bla concurrent with clinical trials companies often complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cgmp requirements the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and among other things must develop methods for testing the identity strength quality purity and potency of the final drug additionally appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life bla submission and review assuming successful completion of all required clinical testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements an applicant may submit a bla requesting licensing to market the biologic for one or more indications in the united states the bla must include the results of product development non clinical studies and clinical trials detailed information on the product 146 s chemistry manufacture and controls and proposed labeling under the prescription drug user fee amendments a bla submission is subject to an application user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies the fda will initially review the bla for completeness before accepting it for filing under the fda 146 s procedures the agency has 60 days from its receipt of a bla to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing and substantive review if the agency determines that the application does not meet this initial threshold standard the fda may refuse to file the application and request additional information in which case the application must be resubmitted with the requested information and review of the application delayed with certain exceptions blas must include a pediatric assessment generally based on clinical trial data of the safety and effectiveness of the biologic in relevant pediatric populations under certain circumstances the fda may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment either at the sponsor 146 s request or by the agency 146 s initiative after the bla is accepted for filing the fda reviews the bla to determine among other things whether a product is safe pure and potent and if the facility in which it is manufactured processed packed or held meets standards table of contents designed to assure the product 146 s continued identity strength quality safety purity and potency the fda may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions before approving a bla the fda will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured the fda will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cgmp and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications in addition the fda expects that all data be reliable and accurate and requires sponsors to implement meaningful and effective strategies to manage data integrity risks data integrity is an important component of the sponsor 146 s responsibility to ensure the safety efficacy and quality of its product or products the fda will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cgcp regulations before approving a bla if the fda determines that the application manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information the fda ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval fda performance goals generally provide for action on a bla within ten months of filing which as discussed above typically occurs within 60 days of submission but that deadline is extended in certain circumstances furthermore the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification the fda may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee typically an advisory committee consists of a panel that includes clinicians and other experts who will review evaluate and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and if so under what conditions the fda is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and usually has followed such recommendations after the fda evaluates a bla and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and or its components will be produced the fda may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter the 147 crl 148 an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications a crl will describe all of the deficiencies that the fda has identified in the bla except that where the fda determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval the fda may issue the crl without first conducting required inspections testing submitted product lots and or reviewing proposed labeling if and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the fda 146 s satisfaction in a resubmission of the bla the fda will issue an approval letter in issuing the crl the fda may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the bla in condition for approval including requests for additional data information or clarification the fda may delay or refuse approval of a bla if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and may require additional testing or information and or require post marketing studies and clinical trials even with submission of this additional information the fda ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval during the approval process the fda will determine whether a rems is necessary to assure the safe use of the biologic a rems is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use and could include medication guides physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use such as restricted distribution methods patient registries and other risk minimization tools if the fda concludes that a rems is needed the bla sponsor must submit a proposed rems and the fda will not approve the bla without a rems that the agency has determined is acceptable in addition under the pediatric research equity act of 2003 the 147 prea 148 as amended and reauthorized certain applications or supplements must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective the fda may on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements if the fda approves a product it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or require that contraindications warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling the fda may also require that post table of contents approval studies including phase 4 clinical trials be conducted to further assess the drug 146 s safety after approval the fda may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post marketing studies or surveillance programs the fda may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization for biologics such testing may include official lot release which requires the manufacturer to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution the manufacturer then typically must submit samples of each lot of product to the fda together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer 146 s tests performed on the lot the fda may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products itself before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer after approval many types of changes to the approved product such as adding new indications manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims are often subject to further testing requirements and fda review and approval depending on the nature of the post approval change the fda may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre and post marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace post approval requirements any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to fda approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda including among other things requirements relating to recordkeeping periodic reporting reporting of certain deviations and adverse experiences product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product after approval most changes to the approved product such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to fda review and approval there also are continuing user fee requirements under which the fda assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved bla biologic manufacturers and their third party contractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies these establishments are subject to routine and periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with cgmp and data integrity requirements which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements to assure quality of manufacturing and product the fda has increasingly observed cgmp violations involving data integrity during site inspections and investigating compliance with data integrity requirements is a significant focus of its oversight requirements with respect to data integrity include among other things controls to ensure data are complete and secure activities documented at the time of performance audit trail functionality authorized access and limitations validated computer systems and review of records for accuracy completeness and compliance with established standards post approval changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and depending on the significance of the change may require fda approval before being implemented fda regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cgmp and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third party manufacturers that we may decide to use accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cgmp data integrity pharmacovigilance i e post marketing safety reporting obligations and other aspects of regulatory compliance the fda may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information imposition of post approval studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a rems other potential consequences include restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product fines warning letters untitled letters or holds on post approval clinical studies refusal of the fda to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals product seizure or detention or refusal of the fda to permit the import or export of products that it believes present safety problems by issuing an import alert table of contents permanent injunctions and consent decrees including the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or voluntary product recall the fda strictly regulates the marketing labeling advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy purity and potency that are approved by the fda and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label the fda 146 s regulation includes among other things standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising communications regarding unapproved uses industry sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet and social media promotional claims relating to a product 146 s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved after approval a product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the fda as reflected in the product 146 s prescribing information in the united states healthcare professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug 146 s labeling known as off label uses because the fda does not regulate the practice of medicine however fda regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers 146 communications prohibiting the promotion of off label uses it may be permissible under very specific narrow conditions for a manufacturer to engage in non promotional non misleading communication regarding off label information such as distributing scientific or medical journal information if a company is found to have promoted off label uses it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the fda the doj or the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services as well as other federal and state authorities this could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes products the federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees and permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed the distribution of prescription drugs and biologics are subject to the drug supply chain security act the 147 dscsa 148 which requires manufacturers and other stakeholders to comply with product identification tracing verification detection and response notification and licensing requirements in addition the prescription drug marketing act the 147 pdma 148 and its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and the dscsa imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove prescription drug and biological products that may be counterfeit stolen contaminated or otherwise harmful from the market patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity after approval owners of relevant drug or biological product patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension to restore a portion of patent term lost during product development and fda review of a bla if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of a biologic containing the active ingredient under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 referred to as the hatch waxman act the allowable patent term extension is calculated as one half of the product 146 s testing phase which is the time between ind and bla submission and all of the review phase which is the time between bla submission and approval up to a maximum of five years the time can be shortened if the fda determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence the total patent term after the extension may not exceed more than 14 years from the date of fda approval of the product only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval the united states patent and trademark office the 147 uspto 148 in consultation with the fda reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration for patents that might expire during the application phase the patent owner may request an interim patent extension an interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times for each interim patent extension granted the post approval patent extension is reduced by one year the director of the uspto must determine that approval of the drug candidate covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely interim patent extensions are not available for a drug candidate for which a bla has not been submitted table of contents expedited development and review programs the fda is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of pharmaceutical products that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical need for the condition under the fast track program the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the fda to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the ind for the drug candidate the fda must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor 146 s request in addition to other benefits such as the ability to have more frequent interactions with the fda the agency may initiate review of sections of a fast track product 146 s bla before the application is complete this rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the fda approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees however the fda 146 s pdufa review period for a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the bla is submitted in addition the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the fda if the agency believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process healthcare regulation pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval in the united states sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payors third party payors include government authorities managed care providers private health insurers and other organizations third party payors establish the coverage and reimbursement policies for pharmaceutical products and the marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale depends on those payors 146 coverage policies and reimbursement rates third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include one or more of our drug candidates if approved third party payors together with regulators and others are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and health services in addition to their cost effectiveness safety and efficacy in addition no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the united states third party payors often rely upon medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies but also have their own methods and approval process apart from medicare determinations therefore coverage and reimbursement rates can vary significantly from payor to payor moreover obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time consuming and costly process we may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third party payor separately with no assurance that approval will be obtained and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products we cannot be certain that our drug candidates will be considered cost effective by third party payors this process could delay the market acceptance of any drug candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results other u s healthcare laws and compliance requirements in the united states our business may be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business particularly once third party reimbursement becomes available for one or more of our products the healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to the federal anti kickback statute which prohibits among other things knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or paying any remuneration including any kickback bribe or rebate directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under the medicare and medicaid programs or other federal healthcare programs the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws including the civil false claims act or fca which prohibits among other things knowingly presenting or causing to be presented table of contents claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making or using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the 147 hipaa 148 which among other things prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private third party payors and prohibits i knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation and ii making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 the 147 hitech 148 and their respective implementing regulations which impose requirements relating to the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities including health plans healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their business associates individuals or entities that perform certain services on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information hitech also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties amended hipaa to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce hipaa and seek attorneys 146 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions the federal physician payments sunshine act being implemented as the open payments program which requires manufacturers of drugs devices biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children 146 s health insurance program with certain exceptions to report annually to the centers for medicare and medicaid services the 147 cms 148 information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held in a company by physicians and their immediate family members beginning in 2022 applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives and u s state and local laws and regulations such as state anti kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non governmental third party payors including private insurers state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry 146 s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers state laws that restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drugs state laws and local ordinances that require identification or licensing of sales representatives and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa thus complicating compliance efforts we will be required to spend substantial time and money to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations even then governmental authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations if governmental authorities find that our operations violate any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us we may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement individual imprisonment exclusion from government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid and additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non compliance with these laws and we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations moreover we expect that there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations proposed and implemented that could impact our operations and business in addition the approval and commercialization of any drug candidate we table of contents develop outside the united states will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above among other foreign laws the extent to which future legislation or regulations if any relating to health care fraud and abuse laws or enforcement may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain healthcare reform in the united states there have been and continue to be several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed reforms of the healthcare system to contain costs improve quality and expand access to care in the united states there have been and continue to be a number of healthcare related legislative initiatives that have significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry for example the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the 147 aca 148 was passed in march 2010 substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacting the u s pharmaceutical industry among other things the aca subjects biologics to potential competition by lower cost biosimilars addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled infused instilled implanted or injected increases the minimum medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and creates a new medicare part d coverage gap discount program in which as a condition of coverage of its products under medicare part d manufacturers must now agree to offer 70 point of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period some of the provisions of the aca have yet to be fully implemented while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and congressional challenges in addition there have been efforts by the trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the aca and to alter the implementation of the aca and related laws for example congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the aca while congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the aca have been signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 147 tax act 148 includes a provision repealing effective january 1 2019 the tax based shared responsibility payment imposed by the aca on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year commonly referred to as the 147 individual mandate 148 on january 22 2018 president trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain aca mandated fees including the so called 147 cadillac 148 tax on certain high cost employer sponsored insurance plans the annual fee imposed on certain high cost employer sponsored insurance plans the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share and the medical device excise tax on non exempt medical devices the bipartisan budget act of 2018 the 147 bba 148 among other things amends the aca effective january 1 2019 to reduce the coverage gap in most medicare drug plans commonly referred to as the 147 donut hole 148 in addition in july 2018 the cms issued a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain aca qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the aca risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method cms uses to determine this risk adjustment additional legislative changes or regulatory changes related to the aca remain possible in december 2018 a united states district court judge for the northern district of texas ruled that the entire aca is unconstitutional because the tax penalty associated with the 147 individual mandate 148 was repealed by congress as part of the tax act this ruling is under appeal and stayed pending appeal while the united states district court judge for the northern district of texas as well as the trump administration and the cms have stated that the ruling will have no effect while this appeal is pending it is unclear how this decision subsequent appeals and other efforts to invalidate the aca regulations promulgated under the aca or portions thereof will impact the aca and its implementation additionally there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the united states with respect to specialty drug pricing practices specifically there have been several recent u s congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other things bring more transparency to drug pricing reduce the cost of prescription drugs under medicare review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs for example the trump administration released a 147 blueprint 148 to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of table of contents drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers on january 31 2019 office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services proposed modifications to the federal anti kickback statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which among other things if finalized will remove safe harbor protection from rebates paid by manufacturers to medicare part d plans medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations although a number of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective congress and the trump administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and or administrative measures to control drug costs individual states in the united states have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing including price or patient reimbursement limitations discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing in addition regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs moreover on may 30 2018 the right to try act was signed into law the law among other things provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for fda approval under certain circumstances eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining fda permission under the fda expanded access program there is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the right to try act table of contents directors and executive

annual general meeting may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the cayman islands may register as a limited duration company and may register as a segregated portfolio company table of contents 147 limited liability 148 means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company differences in corporate law the companies law is modeled after that of england but does not follow recent english statutory enactments and differs from laws applicable to u s corporations and their shareholders set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the companies law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the united states and their shareholders mergers and similar arrangements the companies law permits mergers and consolidations between cayman islands companies and between cayman islands companies and non cayman islands companies for these purposes a 147 merger 148 means the merging of two or more constituent companies and the vesting of their undertaking property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving company and b a 147 consolidation 148 means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a consolidated company and the vesting of the undertaking property and liabilities of such companies to the consolidated company in order to effect such a merger or consolidation the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation which must then be authorized by a a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company and b such other authorization if any as may be specified in such constituent company 146 s articles of association the plan of merger or consolidation must be filed with the registrar of companies of the cayman islands together with a declaration as to the solvency of the consolidated or surviving company a statement of the assets and liabilities of each constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members and creditors of each constituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the cayman islands gazette court approval is not required for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures a merger between a cayman parent company and its cayman subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution of shareholders if a copy of the plan of merger is given to every member of that cayman subsidiary to be merged unless that member agrees otherwise for this purpose a company is a 147 parent 148 of a subsidiary if it holds issued shares that together represent at least ninety percent 90 of the votes at a general meeting of the subsidiary the consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest over a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived by a court in the cayman islands save in certain limited circumstances a shareholder of a cayman constituent company who dissents from the merger or consolidation is entitled to payment of the fair value of his or her shares which if not agreed between the parties will be determined by the cayman islands court upon dissenting to the merger or consolidation provided that the dissenting shareholder complies strictly with the procedures set out in the companies law the exercise of dissenter rights will preclude the exercise by the dissenting shareholder of any other rights to which he or she might otherwise be entitled by virtue of holding shares save for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation is void or unlawful separate from the statutory provisions relating to mergers and consolidations the companies law also contains statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies by way of schemes of arrangement provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent three fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors as the case may be that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting or meetings convened for that purpose the convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the grand court of the cayman islands while a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class table of contents the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man or woman of that class acting in respect of his interest and the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the companies law when a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90 of the shares within four months the offeror may within a two month period commencing on the expiration of such four month period require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares to the offeror on the terms of the offer an objection can be made to the grand court of the cayman islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud bad faith or collusion if an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved or if a takeover offer is made and accepted a dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of delaware corporations providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares shareholders 146 suits in principle we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder however based on english authorities which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the cayman islands the cayman islands courts can be expected to follow and apply the common law principles namely the rule in foss v harbottle and the exceptions thereto which may permit a minority shareholder to commence a class action against or derivative actions in the name of our company to challenge an act which is ultra vires or illegal and is therefore incapable of ratification by the shareholders an act which constitutes a fraud against the minority where the wrongdoers are themselves in control of the company and an act which requires a resolution with a qualified or special majority i e more than a simple majority which has not been obtained indemnification of directors and executive officers and limitation of liability cayman islands law does not limit the extent to which a company 146 s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors except to the extent any such provision may be held by the cayman islands courts to be contrary to public policy such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime our post offering memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers and directors for losses damages costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such unless such losses damages costs and expenses arise from dishonesty wilful default or fraud of such directors or officers this standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the delaware general corporation law for a delaware corporation in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our post offering memorandum and articles of association insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to our directors officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions we have been informed that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable directors 146 fiduciary duties under delaware corporate law a director of a delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders this duty has two components the duty of care and the duty of loyalty the duty of care requires that a director act in good faith with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances under this duty a director must inform himself of and disclose to shareholders all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction the duty of loyalty requires that a director acts in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation he or she must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage this duty prohibits self dealing by a director and mandates that the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally in general actions of a table of contents director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation however this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director the director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation as a matter of cayman islands law a director of a cayman islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he or she owes the following duties to the company 151 a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company a duty not to make a personal profit based on his or her position as director unless the company permits him or her to do so a duty not to put himself or herself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party and a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which such powers were intended a director of a cayman islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care it was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience however english and commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the cayman islands shareholder action by written consent under the delaware general corporation law a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation cayman islands law and our post offering articles of association provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of each shareholder who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held shareholder proposals under the delaware general corporation law a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents a special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings the companies law does not provide shareholders with any right to requisition a general meeting nor any right to put any proposal before a general meeting however these rights may be provided in a company 146 s articles of association our post offering articles of association allow our shareholders holding in aggregate not less than one tenth of all votes attaching to the issued and outstanding shares of our company entitled to vote at general meetings to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders in which case our board is obliged to convene an extraordinary general meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting other than this right to requisition a shareholders 146 meeting our post offering articles of association do not provide our shareholders with any other right to put proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings as an exempted cayman islands company we are not obliged by law to call shareholders 146 annual general meetings cumulative voting under the delaware general corporation law cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation 146 s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director which increases the shareholder 146 s voting power with respect to electing such director there are no prohibitions in relation to cumulative voting under the laws of the cayman islands but our post offering articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting as a result our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a delaware corporation removal of directors under the delaware general corporation law a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise under our post offering articles of association subject to certain restrictions as contained therein directors may be removed with or without cause by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders a director shall hold office until the expiration of his or her term or his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified or until his or her office is otherwise vacated in addition a director 146 s office shall table of contents be vacated if the director i becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his or her creditors ii is found to be or becomes of unsound mind or dies iii resigns his or her office by notice in writing to the company iv without special leave of absence from our board of directors is absent from three consecutive meetings of the board and the board resolves that his or her office be vacated v is prohibited by law from being a director or vi is removed from office pursuant to any other provisions of our post offering memorandum and articles of association transactions with interested shareholders the delaware general corporation law contains a business combination statute applicable to delaware corporations whereby unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an 147 interested shareholder 148 for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder an interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15 or more of the target 146 s outstanding voting share within the past three years this has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally the statute does not apply if among other things prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder this encourages any potential acquirer of a delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target 146 s board of directors cayman islands law has no comparable statute as a result we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the delaware business combination statute however although cayman islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders dissolution winding up under the delaware general corporation law unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100 of the total voting power of the corporation only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation 146 s outstanding shares delaware law allows a delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board under cayman islands law a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the cayman islands or by a special resolution of its members or if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due by an ordinary resolution of its members the court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is in the opinion of the court just and equitable to do so under the companies law and our post offering articles of association our company may be dissolved liquidated or wound up by a special resolution of our shareholders variation of rights of shares under the delaware general corporation law a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise under our post offering articles of association if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares we may vary the rights attached to any class with the written consent of the holders of all of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class amendment of governing documents under the delaware general corporation law a corporation 146 s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise as permitted by cayman islands law our post offering memorandum and articles of association may only be amended with a special resolution of our shareholders table of contents history of securities issuances the following is a summary of our securities issuances in the past three

cayman islands prc taxation under the prc enterprise income tax law and its implementation rules an enterprise established outside china with 147 de facto management body 148 within china is considered as a tax resident enterprise for prc enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25 enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income the implementation rules define the term 147 de facto management body 148 as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business productions personnel accounts and properties of an enterprise in april 2009 the state administration of taxation issued circular 82 which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the 147 de facto management body 148 of a prc controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in china although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by prc enterprises or prc enterprise groups not those controlled by prc individuals or foreigners the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the state administration of taxation 146 s general position on how the 147 de facto management body 148 text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises according to circular 82 an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a prc enterprise or a prc enterprise group will be regarded as a prc tax resident by virtue of having its 147 de facto management body 148 in china if all of the following conditions are met i the primary location of the day to day operational management is in china ii decisions relating to the enterprise 146 s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel located in china iii the enterprise 146 s primary assets accounting books and records company seals and board and shareholder resolutions are located or maintained in china and iv at least 50 of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in china our prc counsel junhe llp is of the opinion that based on its understanding of the current prc laws and regulations i mab should not be considered as a prc resident enterprise for prc income tax purposes because i mab does not meet all of the above conditions i mab is incorporated outside of china and it is not controlled by a prc enterprise or prc enterprise group we have structured a clear management guideline in place to segregate the policy set up and business operating execution responsibilities in order to differentiate the effective control from our headquarter office and subsidiaries including record keeping and offshore work location plan i mab is a company incorporated outside the prc as a holding company its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries and its key assets are located and its records including the resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of its shareholders are maintained outside china however the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to table of contents determination by the prc tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term 147 de facto management body 148 however we cannot guarantee you that prc tax authorities will not take a different view if the prc tax authorities determine that i mab is a prc resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes our worldwide income could be subject to 25 enterprise income tax and any dividends payable to non resident enterprise holders of our common shares or adss may be treated as income derived from sources within china and therefore subject to a 10 withholding tax or 20 in the case of non resident individual holders unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise in addition capital gains realized by non resident enterprise shareholders including our ads holders upon the disposition of our common shares or adss may be treated as income derived from sources within prc and therefore subject to 10 income tax or 20 in the case of non resident individual shareholders or ads holders unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise it is unclear whether non prc shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the prc in the event that we are treated as a prc resident enterprise see 147 risk factors 151 risks related to doing business in china 151 if we are classified as a prc resident enterprise for prc income tax purposes such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non prc shareholders or ads holders 148 united states federal income tax considerations the following discussion is a summary of u s federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition of our adss or ordinary shares by a u s holder as defined below that acquires our adss in this offering and holds our adss as 147 capital assets 148 generally property held for investment under the u s internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code this discussion is based upon existing u s federal tax law which is subject to differing interpretations or change possibly with retroactive effect no ruling has been sought from the u s internal revenue service or the irs with respect to any u s federal income tax consequences described below and there can be no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position this discussion does not address the u s federal estate gift medicare and alternative minimum tax considerations certain information reporting requirements pursuant to section 1471 through 1474 of the code or any state local and non u s tax considerations relating to the ownership or disposition of our adss or ordinary shares this discussion moreover does not discuss all aspects of u s federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances or to investors subject to special tax situations such as banks and other financial institutions insurance companies regulated investment companies real estate investment trusts broker dealers traders in securities that elect to use a mark to market method of accounting certain former u s citizens or long term residents tax exempt entities including private foundations investors who are not u s holders investors who own directly indirectly or constructively 10 or more of our stock by vote or value investors who acquire their adss or ordinary shares pursuant to any employee share option or otherwise as compensation investors that will hold their adss or ordinary shares as part of a straddle hedge conversion constructive sale or other integrated transaction for u s federal income tax purposes investors required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to our adss or ordinary shares as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement or investors that have a functional currency other than the u s dollar table of contents all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those discussed below each u s holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the u s federal state local and non u s income and other tax considerations of an investment in our adss or ordinary shares general for purposes of this discussion a 147 u s holder 148 is a beneficial owner of our adss or ordinary shares that is for u s federal income tax purposes i an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states ii a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for u s federal income tax purposes created in or organized under the law of the united states or any state thereof or the district of columbia iii an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for u s federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or iv a trust a the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a u s court and which has one or more u s persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b that has otherwise validly elected to be treated as a u s person under the code if a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for u s federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of our adss or ordinary shares the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership partnerships holding our adss or ordinary shares and their partners are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding an investment in our adss or ordinary shares for u s federal income tax purposes it is generally expected that a u s holder of adss will be treated as the beneficial owner of the underlying shares represented by the adss the remainder of this discussion assumes that a u s holder of our adss will be treated as the beneficial owner of the underlying shares represented by the adss accordingly deposits or withdrawals of ordinary shares for adss will generally not be subject to u s federal income tax passive foreign investment company considerations a non u s corporation such as our company will be classified as a passive foreign investment company or or pfic for u s federal income tax purposes for any taxable year if either i 75 or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of 147 passive 148 income or ii 50 or more of the value of its assets determined on the basis of a quarterly average during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income for this purpose cash and assets readily convertible into cash are each categorized as a passive asset and the company 146 s goodwill and other unbooked intangibles are taken into account passive income generally includes among other things dividends interest rents royalties and gains from the disposition of passive assets we will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own directly or indirectly 25 or more by value of the stock no assurance can be given with respect to our pfic status for the current taxable year or any future taxable year the determination of whether we are or will become a pfic is uncertain because it is a fact intensive inquiry made on an annual basis that depends in part on the composition of our income and assets fluctuations in the market price of our adss may cause us to become a pfic for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of our assets for the purpose of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market price of our adss from time to time which may be volatile for biopharmaceutical companies such as ours that have not yet achieved commercialization with respect to any of their products the composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how and how quickly we use our liquid assets and the cash raised in this offering under circumstances where our revenue from activities that produce passive income increases relative to our revenue from activities that produce non passive income or where we determine not to deploy cash for active purposes our risk of becoming classified as a pfic will substantially increase in addition because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules it is possible that the irs may challenge our classification of certain income and assets as non passive or our valuation of our tangible and intangible assets each of which may result in our being or becoming a pfic for the current or subsequent taxable years the discussion below under 147 151 dividends 148 and 147 151 sale or other disposition of adss or ordinary shares 148 is written on the basis that we will not be classified as a pfic for u s federal income tax purposes the u s federal income tax rules that apply if we are treated as a pfic are generally discussed below under 147 151 passive foreign investment company rules 148 table of contents dividends subject to the discussion below under 147 151 passive foreign investment company rules 148 any cash distributions including the amount of any tax withheld paid on our adss or ordinary shares out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under u s federal income tax principles will generally be includible in the gross income of a u s holder as dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the u s holder because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of u s federal income tax principles any distribution we pay will generally be reported as a 147 dividend 148 for u s federal income tax purposes dividends received on our adss or ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations in respect of dividends received from u s corporations a non corporate u s holder will generally be subject to tax on dividend income from a 147 qualified foreign corporation 148 at a lower applicable capital gains rate rather than the marginal tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income provided that certain conditions are satisfied including that 1 our adss or ordinary shares on which the dividends are paid are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states or in the event that we are deemed to be a prc resident enterprise under the prc tax law we are eligible for the benefits of the united states prc income tax treaty the 147 treaty 148 2 we are neither a pfic nor treated as such with respect to a u s holder for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid and the preceding taxable year and 3 certain holding period requirements are met the adss have been approved for listing on the nasdaq global market provided the listing is approved we believe that the adss will be readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states and that we will be a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on the adss since we do not expect that our ordinary shares will be listed on an established securities market we do not believe that dividends that we pay on our ordinary shares that are not represented by adss will meet the conditions required for the reduced tax rate there can be no assurance however that our adss will continue to be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in later years in the event that we are deemed to be a prc resident enterprise under the prc enterprise income tax law we may be eligible for the benefits of treaty and in that case we would be treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on our ordinary shares or adss each non corporate u s holder is advised to consult its tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income for any dividends we pay with respect to our adss or ordinary shares dividends will generally be treated as income from foreign sources for u s foreign tax credit purposes and will generally constitute passive category income in the event that we are deemed to be a prc resident enterprise under the prc enterprise income tax law a u s holder may be subject to prc withholding taxes on dividends paid on our adss or ordinary shares see 147 151 prc taxation 148 above in that case depending on the u s holder 146 s individual facts and circumstances a u s holder may be eligible subject to a number of complex limitations to claim a foreign tax credit not in excess of any applicable treaty rate in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on our adss or ordinary shares a u s holder who does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction for u s federal income tax purposes in respect of such withholding but only for a year in which such holder elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes the rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex and their outcome depends in large part on the u s holder 146 s individual facts and circumstances accordingly u s holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances sale or other disposition of adss or ordinary shares subject to the discussion below under 147 150 150 passive foreign investment company rules 148 a u s holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of adss or ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the disposition and the holder 146 s adjusted tax basis in such adss or ordinary shares any capital gain or loss will be long term if the adss or ordinary shares have been held for more than one year and will generally be u s source gain or loss for u s foreign tax credit purposes long term capital gain of non corporate u s holders is generally eligible for a reduced rate of taxation the deductibility of a capital loss may be subject to limitations in the event that we are treated as a prc resident enterprise under the enterprise income tax law and gain from the disposition of the adss or ordinary shares is subject to tax in china a u s holder that is eligible for the benefits of the treaty may elect to treat the gain as prc source income if a u s holder is not eligible for the benefits of the treaty or fails to make the election to treat any gain as foreign source table of contents then such u s holder may not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any prc tax imposed on the disposition of the adss or ordinary shares unless such credit can be applied subject to applicable limitations against u s federal income tax due on other income derived from foreign sources in the same income category generally the passive category u s holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign tax is imposed on a disposition of our adss or ordinary shares including the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances and the election to treat any gain as prc source income passive foreign investment company rules if we are classified as a pfic for any taxable year during which a u s holder holds our adss or ordinary shares and unless the u s holder makes a mark to market election as described below the u s holder will generally be subject to special tax rules that have a penalizing effect regardless of whether we remain a pfic on i any excess distribution that we make to the u s holder which generally means any distribution paid during a taxable year to a u s holder that is greater than 125 percent of the average annual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years or if shorter the u s holder 146 s holding period for the adss or ordinary shares and ii any gain realized on the sale or other disposition including under certain circumstances a pledge of adss or ordinary shares under the pfic rules the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over the u s holder 146 s holding period for the adss or ordinary shares the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable years in the u s holder 146 s holding period prior to the first taxable year in which we are classified as a pfic each a 147 pre pfic year 148 will be taxable as ordinary income and the amount allocated to each prior taxable year other than a pre pfic year will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for individuals or corporations as appropriate for that year increased by an additional tax equal to the interest on the resulting tax deemed deferred with respect to each such taxable year if we are a pfic for any taxable year during which a u s holder holds our adss or ordinary shares and any of our subsidiaries is also a pfic such u s holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount by value of the shares of the lower tier pfic for purposes of the application of these rules u s holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the pfic rules to any of our subsidiaries as an alternative to the foregoing rules a u s holder of 147 marketable stock 148 as defined below in a pfic may make a mark to market election with respect to such stock if a u s holder makes this election the holder will generally i include as ordinary income for each taxable year that we are a pfic the excess if any of the fair market value of adss held at the end of the taxable year over the adjusted tax basis of such adss and ii deduct as an ordinary loss the excess if any of the adjusted tax basis of the adss over the fair market value of such adss held at the end of the taxable year but such deduction will only be allowed to the extent of the amount previously included in income as a result of the mark to market election the u s holder 146 s adjusted tax basis in the adss would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark to market election if a u s holder makes a mark to market election in respect of a corporation classified as a pfic and such corporation ceases to be classified as a pfic the holder will not be required to take into account the gain or loss described above during any period that such corporation is not classified as a pfic if a u s holder makes a mark to market election any gain such u s holder recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of our adss in a year when we are a pfic will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss but such loss will only be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark to market election if a u s holder makes a mark to market election it will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless the adss are no longer treated as marketable stock or the irs consents to the revocation of the election the mark to market election is available only for 147 marketable stock 148 which is stock that is regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market as defined in applicable united states treasury regulations we expect that our adss but not our ordinary shares will be treated as marketable stock upon their listing on the nasdaq global market however we cannot guarantee that once listed our adss will continue to be listed and traded on the nasdaq global market furthermore while we anticipate that our adss should qualify as being regularly traded but no assurances may be given in this regard table of contents because a mark to market election cannot be made for any lower tier pfics that we may own a u s holder may continue to be subject to the pfic rules with respect to such u s holder 146 s indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated as an equity interest in a pfic for u s federal income tax purposes we do not intend to provide information necessary for u s holders to make qualified electing fund elections which if available would result in tax treatment different from the general tax treatment for pfics described above if a u s holder owns our adss or ordinary shares during any taxable year that we are a pfic the holder must generally file an annual irs form 8621

consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 147 u s gaap 148 table of contents significant accounting policies followed by the group in the preparation of its accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below 2 2 basis of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of the company and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained all inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 2 3 use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u s gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities and other intangible assets additionally estimates are used in determining items such as useful lives of property equipment and software impairment of contract assets and other receivables impairment of long lived assets and goodwill share based compensation tax valuation allowances and revenues from licensing and collaboration arrangements management bases the estimates on historical experience known trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates 2 4 fair value measurements financial assets and liabilities of the group primarily comprise of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash other financial assets contract assets other receivables short term borrowings accruals and other payables and warrants liabilities as of december 31 2017 and 2018 except for other financial assets and warrant liabilities the carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximated their fair values because of their generally short maturities the group reports other financial assets and warrant liabilities at fair value at each balance sheet date and changes in fair value are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss the group measures its financial assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy the three levels are as follows level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the management has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset i e interest rates yield curves etc and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs level 3 includes unobservable inputs that reflect the management 146 s assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset the management develops these inputs based on the best information available including the own data assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the group measured its other financial assets and warrant liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis as the group 146 s other financial assets and warrant liabilities are not traded in an active market with readily observable prices the group uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of other financial assets and warrant liabilities these instruments are categorized in the level 3 valuation hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement table of contents the following table summarizes the group 146 s financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31 2017 and 2018 as of december 31 2017 active market level 1 observable input level 2 non observable input level 3 other financial assets

level 3 warrant liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended december 31 table of contents 2 5 foreign currency translation the group uses chinese renminbi 147 rmb 148 as its reporting currency the united states dollar 147 us 148 is the functional currency of the group 146 s entities incorporated in the cayman islands the united states of america 147 u s 148 and hong kong the australia dollar 147 aud 148 is the functional currency of the group 146 s entity incorporated in australia and the rmb is the functional currency of the company 146 s prc subsidiaries transactions denominated in other than the functional currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates assets and liabilities denominated in other than the functional currencies are translated at the balance sheet date exchange rate the resulting exchange differences are recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss the consolidated financial statements of the group are translated from the functional currency to the reporting currency rmb assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into rmb using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing for the year foreign currency translation adjustments arising from these are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income the exchange rates used for translation on december 31 2017 and 2018 were us 1 00 rmb6 5342 and rmb6 8632 respectively representing the index rates stipulated by the people 146 s bank of china translations of balances in the consolidated balance sheets consolidated statements of comprehensive loss consolidated statements of changes in shareholders 146 equity deficit and consolidated statements of cash flows from rmb into us as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 are solely for the convenience of the readers and were calculated at the rate of us 1 00 rmb7 1477 representing the noon buying rate in the city of new york for cable transfers of rmb as certified for customs purposes by the federal reserve bank of new york on september 30 2019 no representation is made that the rmb amounts could have been or could be converted realized or settled into us at that rate on september 30 2019 or at any other rate the us convenience translation is not required under u s gaap and all us convenience translation amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited 2 6 cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and bank deposits which are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 2 7 restricted cash restricted cash consists of the guarantee deposits held in a designated bank account as security deposits under bank borrowing agreements such restricted cash will be released when the group repays the related bank borrowings 2 8 property equipment and software property equipment and software are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives taking into account any estimated residual value laboratory equipment office furniture and equipment leasehold improvements lesser of useful life or lease term the group recognized the gain or loss on the disposal of property equipment and software in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 2 9 intangible assets intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable amortization is initiated for in process research and development table of contents ipr amp d intangible assets that are acquired from business combination when their useful lives have been determined ipr amp d intangible assets which are determined to have an impairment in their fair value are adjusted downward and an expense recognized in research and development in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss these ipr amp d intangible assets are tested at least an annual basis on december 31 or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment see note 7 2 10 impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable long lived assets are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 there was no impairment of the value of the group 146 s long lived assets 2 11 goodwill goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized the group allocates the cost of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition the excess of the purchase price for acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired including other intangible assets is recorded as goodwill goodwill is not amortized but impairment of goodwill assessment is performed on at least an annual basis on december 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the group has elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the group 146 s reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill the qualitative assessment includes the group 146 s evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting the group 146 s single reporting unit including macroeconomic industry market conditions and the group 146 s overall financial performance if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the group 146 s reporting unit 146 s fair value is less than its carrying amount then the group will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the reporting unit 146 s carrying amount including goodwill to its fair value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 the group determined that there were no indicators of impairment of the goodwill 2 12 deferred subsidy income deferred subsidy income consists of deferred income from government grants government grants consist of cash subsidies received by the group 146 s subsidiaries in the prc from local governments as support on expenses relating to certain projects grants received with government specified performance obligations are recognized when all the obligations have been fulfilled if such obligations are not satisfied the group may be required to refund the subsidy cash grants of rmb2 500 was recorded in deferred subsidy income as of december 31 2018 which will be recognized when the government specified performance obligation is satisfied which is expected to be more than 12 months after december 31 2018 2 13 revenue recognition the group adopted accounting standard codification 147 asc 148 606 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 147 asc 606 148 for all periods presented consistent with the criteria of topic 606 the group recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services under asc 606 an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services to determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of asc 606 the entity performs the following five steps i identify the contract s with a customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price including variable consideration if any iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation the group only applies the five step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer table of contents once a contract is determined to be within the scope of asc 606 at contract inception the group reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations it must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct the group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each performance obligation when that performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied collaboration revenue at contract inception the group analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of asc 808 collaborative arrangements 147 asc 808 148 to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities for collaboration arrangements within the scope of asc 808 that contain multiple elements the group first determines if the collaboration is deemed to be within the scope of asc 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor customer relationship and therefore within the scope of asc 606 for the collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to asc 808 an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently the group 146 s collaborative arrangements may contain more than one unit of account or performance obligation including grants of licenses to intellectual property rights agreement to provide research and development services and other deliverables the collaborative arrangements do not include a right of return for any deliverable as part of the accounting for these arrangements the group must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract in developing the stand alone selling price for a performance obligation the group considers competitor pricing for a similar or identical product market awareness of and perception of the product expected product life and current market trends in general the consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when the respective obligation is satisfied either by delivering a good or providing a service limited to the consideration that is not constrained when the timing of the delivery of product is different from the timing of payments made by the customers the group recognizes either a contract asset performance precedes the contractual due date or a contract liability customer payment precedes performance the group 146 s contractual payment terms are typically due in no more than 30 days from invoicing in limited situations certain customer contractual payment terms require the group to bill in arrears thus the group satisfies some or all of the performance obligations before the group is contractually entitled to bill the customer in these situations billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition which results in a contract asset for example certain of the contractual arrangements do not permit the group to bill until the completion of the production of the samples in other limited situations certain customer contractual payment terms allow the group to bill in advance thus the group receives customer cash payment before satisfying some or all of its performance obligations in these situations billing occurs in advance of revenue recognition which results in contract liabilities licenses of intellectual property upfront non refundable payments for licensing the group 146 s intellectual property are evaluated to determine if the license is distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement for licenses determined to be distinct the group recognizes revenues from non refundable up front fees allocated to the license at a point in time when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license research and development services the portion of the transaction price allocated to research and development services performance obligations is deferred and recognized as collaboration revenue over time as delivery or performance of such services occurs milestone payments at the inception of each arrangement that includes development commercialization and regulatory milestone payments the group evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and to the extent that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur in future periods estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method the transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand alone selling price basis for which the group recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied at the end of each subsequent reporting period the group re evaluates the probability of achieving such development milestones and any related constraint and if necessary adjust the estimate of the overall transaction price any such table of contents adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch up basis which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment royalties for arrangements that include sales based royalties including milestone payments based on the level of sales and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate the group recognizes revenue at the later of i when the related sales occur or ii when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied 2 14 value added tax 147 vat 148 recoverable and surcharges value added tax recoverable represent amounts paid by the group for purchases the surcharges i e urban construction and maintenance tax educational surtax local educational surtax vary from 6 to 17 of the value added tax depending on the tax payer 146 s location 2 15 research and development expenses elements of research and development expenses primarily include 1 payroll and other related expenses of personnel engaged in research and development activities 2 in licensed patent rights fee of exclusive development rights of drugs granted to the group 3 expenses related to preclinical testing of the group 146 s technologies and clinical trials such as payments to contract research organizations 147 cro 148 investigators and clinical trial sites that conduct the clinical studies 4 expenses to develop the product candidates including raw materials and supplies product testing depreciation and facility related expenses 5 other research and development expenses research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred when these expenditures relate to the group 146 s research and development services and have no alternative future uses the group has acquired rights to develop and commercialize product candidates upfront payments that relate to the acquisition of a new drug compound as well as pre commercial milestone payments are immediately expensed as acquired in process research and development in the period in which they are incurred provided that the new drug compound did not also include processes or activities that would constitute a 147 business 148 as defined under u s gaap the drug has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and absent obtaining such approval has no established alternative future use milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval would be capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the related product the conditions enabling capitalization of development expenses as an asset have not yet been met and therefore all development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss when incurred 2 16 leases leases are classified at the inception date as either a capital lease or an operating lease the group assesses a lease to be a capital lease if any of the following conditions exist 1 ownership is transferred to the lessee by the end of the lease term 2 there is a bargain purchase option 3 the lease term is at least 75 of the property 146 s estimated remaining economic life or 4 the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term is 90 or more of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception date a capital lease is accounted for as if there was an acquisition of an asset and an incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the lease the group has no capital leases for the years presented all other leases are accounted for as operating leases wherein rental payments are expensed on a straight line basis over the periods of their respective lease terms certain of the lease agreements contain rent holidays rent holidays are considered in determining the straight line rent expense to be recorded over the lease term the lease term begins on the date of initial possession of the lease property for purposes of recognizing lease expense on straight line basis over the term of the lease 2 17 comprehensive loss comprehensive loss is defined as the changes in equity of the group during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners among other disclosures asc 220 comprehensive income requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive loss be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements for each of the periods presented the group 146 s comprehensive loss includes net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments which are presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss table of contents 2 18 share based compensation the company grants restricted shares and stock options to eligible employees and accounts for share based compensation in accordance with asc 718 compensation 151 stock compensation employees 146 share based compensation awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the awards and recognized as expenses a immediately at the grant date if no vesting conditions are required or b for share based awards granted with only service conditions using the graded vesting method net of estimated forfeitures over the vesting period or c for share based awards granted with service conditions and the occurrence of an initial public offering 147 ipo 148 as performance condition cumulative share based compensation expenses for the options that have satisfied the service condition should be recorded upon the completion of the ipo using the graded vesting method a change in any of the terms or conditions of share based awards is accounted for as a modification of the awards the group calculates incremental compensation expense of a modification as the excess of the fair value of the modified awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before its terms are modified at the modification date for vested awards the group recognizes incremental compensation cost in the period when the modification occurs for awards not being fully vested the group recognizes the sum of the incremental compensation expense and the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for the original awards over the remaining requisite service period after modification share based compensation in relation to the restricted shares is measured based on the fair market value of the group 146 s ordinary shares at the grant date of the award prior to the listing estimation of the fair value of the group 146 s ordinary shares involves significant assumptions that might not be observable in the market and a number of complex and subjective variables including discount rate and subjective judgments regarding the group 146 s projected financial and operating results its unique business risks the liquidity of its ordinary shares and its operating history and prospects at the time the grants are made share based compensation in relation to the share options is estimated using the binominal option pricing model the determination of the fair value of share options is affected by the share price of the group 146 s ordinary shares as well as the assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including the expected share price volatility risk free interest rate exercise multiple and expected dividend yield the fair value of these awards was determined with the assistance from an independent valuation firm 2 19 income taxes the group accounts for income taxes under the liability method under the liability method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax income rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred income tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future the group evaluates its uncertain tax positions using the provisions of asc 740 10 income taxes which prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements the group recognizes in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position which is 145 145 more likely than not 146 146 to be sustained under examination based solely on the technical merits of the position assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant information tax positions that meet the recognition threshold are measured using a cumulative probability approach at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement it is the group 146 s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits if any as a component of income tax expense 2 20 borrowings borrowings are recognized initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method 2 21 business combination the group accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with asc topic 805 business combinations 147 asc 805 148 the acquisition method of accounting requires all of the table of contents following steps i identifying the acquirer ii determining the acquisition date iii recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and iv recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued as well as the contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date the group allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets may include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired assets timing and probability of success of clinical events and regulatory approvals and assumptions on useful lives of the patents and discount rates management 146 s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates additional information such as that related to income tax and other contingencies existing as of the acquisition date but unknown to us may become known during the remainder of the measurement period not to exceed one year from the acquisition date which may result in changes to the amounts and allocations recorded acquisitions that do not meet the accounting definition of a business combination are accounted for as asset acquisitions for transactions determined to be asset acquisitions the group allocates the total cost of the acquisition including transaction costs to the net assets acquired based on their relative fair values 2 22 segment information in accordance with asc 280 segment reporting the group 146 s chief operating decision maker the chief executive officer reviews the consolidated results when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the group as a whole and hence the group has only one reportable segment the group does not distinguish between markets or segments for the purpose of internal reporting as the group 146 s long lived assets are substantially located in and derived from the prc no geographical segments are presented 2 23 loss per share basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period using the two class method under the two class method the net loss is allocated between ordinary shares and other participating securities based on their participating rights net loss is not allocated to other participating securities if based on

pricing model with the following assumptions year ended december 31 expected volatility risk free interest rate per annum exercise multiple expected dividend yield contractual term in years the expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable peer public companies with a time horizon close to the expected term of the group 146 s options the risk free interest rate was estimated based on the yield to maturity of u s treasury bonds denominated in us for a term consistent with the expected term of the group 146 s options in effect at the option valuation date the expected exercise multiple was estimated as the average ratio of the stock price to the exercise price when employees would decide to voluntarily exercise their vested options as the group did not have sufficient information of past employee exercise history it was estimated by referencing to a widely accepted academic research publication expected dividend yield is zero as the group has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its shares and the group does not anticipate any dividend payments in the foreseeable future expected term is the contract life of the option the fair value of stock options granted to employees for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 amounted to rmb99 0 million and rmb45 2 million respectively since the exercisability is dependent

consistent with article 10 of regulation s x in the opinion of management the group 146 s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes include all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for the fair statement of the group 146 s financial table of contents position as of september 30 2019 and results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended september 30 2018 and 2019 interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year or for any future period these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 and related notes included in the group 146 s audited consolidated financial statements the financial information as of december 31 2018 presented in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018 significant accounting policies followed by the group in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are summarized below 2 2 basis of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of the company and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained all inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 2 3 use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u s gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities and other intangible assets as well as subsequent fair value measurements additionally estimates are used in determining items such as useful lives of property equipment and software impairment of contract assets and other receivables impairment of long lived assets and goodwill share based compensation leases tax valuation allowances and revenues from licensing and collaboration arrangements management bases the estimates on historical experience known trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates 2 4 fair value measurements financial assets and liabilities of the group primarily comprise of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term investments other financial assets contract assets accounts receivable other receivables short term borrowings accruals and other payables and warrants liabilities as of december 31 2018 and september 30 2019 except for short term investments other financial assets and warrant liabilities the carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximated their fair values because of their generally short maturities the group reports short term investments other financial assets and warrant liabilities at fair value at each balance sheet date and changes in fair value are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss the group measures its financial assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy the three levels are as follows level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the management has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset i e interest rates yield curves etc and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs level 3 includes unobservable inputs that reflect the management 146 s assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset the management develops these inputs based on the best information available including the own data assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the group measured its short term investments other financial assets and warrant liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis as the group 146 s short term investments other financial assets and warrant liabilities are not traded in an active market with readily observable prices the group uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair table of contents value of short term investments other financial assets and warrant liabilities these instruments are categorized in the level 3 valuation hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement the following table summarizes the group 146 s financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31 2018 and september 30 2019 as of december 31 2018 active market level 1 observable input level 2 non observable input level 3 other financial assets warrant

level 3 warrant liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the nine months ended september 30 2018 and 2019 2 5 foreign currency translation the group uses chinese renminbi 147 rmb 148 as its reporting currency the united states dollar 147 us 148 is the functional currency of the group 146 s entities incorporated in the cayman islands the united states of america 147 u s 148 and hong kong the australia dollar 147 aud 148 is the functional currency of the group 146 s entity incorporated in australia and the rmb is the functional currency of the company 146 s prc subsidiaries table of contents transactions denominated in other than the functional currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates assets and liabilities denominated in other than the functional currencies are translated at the balance sheet date exchange rate the resulting exchange differences are recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the group are translated from the functional currency to the reporting currency rmb assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into rmb using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing for the year foreign currency translation adjustments arising from these are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income the exchange rates used for translation on december 31 2018 and september 30 2019 were us 1 00 rmb6 8632 and rmb7 0729 respectively representing the index rates stipulated by the people 146 s bank of china translations of balances in the consolidated balance sheets consolidated statements of comprehensive loss consolidated statements of changes in shareholders 146 equity deficit and consolidated statements of cash flows from rmb into us as of and for the nine months ended september 30 2019 are solely for the convenience of the readers and were calculated at the rate of us 1 00 rmb7 1477 representing the noon buying rate in the city of new york for cable transfers of rmb as certified for customs purposes by the federal reserve bank of new york on september 30 2019 no representation is made that the rmb amounts could have been or could be converted realized or settled into us at that rate on september 30 2019 or at any other rate the us convenience translation is not required under u s gaap and all us convenience translation amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited 2 6 accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are recorded at their invoiced amounts net of allowances for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when the collection of the full amount is no longer probable in evaluating the collectability of receivable balances the group considers specific evidence including aging of the receivable the customer 146 s payment history its current creditworthiness and current economic trends accounts receivable are written off after all collection efforts have ceased the group regularly reviews the adequacy and appropriateness of any allowance for doubtful accounts no allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded as of september 30 2019 2 7 short term investments short term investments represent the investments issued by commercial banks or other financial institutions with a variable interest rate indexed to the performance of underlying assets within one year these investments are stated at fair value changes in the fair value are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 2 8 goodwill goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized the group allocates the cost of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition the excess of the purchase price for acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired including other intangible assets is recorded as goodwill goodwill is not amortized but impairment of goodwill assessment is performed on at least an annual basis on december 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the group has elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the group 146 s reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill the qualitative assessment includes the group 146 s evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting the group 146 s single reporting unit including macroeconomic industry market conditions and the group 146 s overall financial performance if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the group 146 s reporting unit 146 s fair value is less than its carrying amount then the group will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the reporting unit 146 s carrying amount including goodwill to its fair value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess for the nine months ended september 30 2018 and 2019 the group determined that there were no indicators of impairment of the goodwill table of contents 2 9 deferred subsidy income deferred subsidy income consists of deferred income from government grants government grants consist of cash subsidies received by the group 146 s subsidiaries in the prc from local governments as support on expenses relating to certain projects grants received with government specified performance obligations are recognized when all the obligations have been fulfilled if such obligations are not satisfied the group may be required to refund the subsidy cash grants of rmb3 920 was recorded in deferred subsidy income as of september 30 2019 which will be recognized when the government specified performance obligation is satisfied which is expected to be more than 12 months after september 30 2019 2 10 revenue recognition the group adopted accounting standard codification 147 asc 148 606 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 147 asc 606 148 for all periods presented consistent with the criteria of topic 606 the group recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services under asc 606 an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services to determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of asc 606 the entity performs the following five steps i identify the contract s with a customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price including variable consideration if any iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation the group only applies the five step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer once a contract is determined to be within the scope of asc 606 at contract inception the group reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations it must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct the group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each performance obligation when that performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied collaboration revenue at contract inception the group analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of asc 808 collaborative arrangements 147 asc 808 148 to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities for collaboration arrangements within the scope of asc 808 that contain multiple elements the group first determines if the collaboration is deemed to be within the scope of asc 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor customer relationship and therefore within the scope of asc 606 for the collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to asc 808 an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently the group 146 s collaborative arrangements may contain more than one unit of account or performance obligation including grants of licenses to intellectual property rights agreement to provide research and development services and other deliverables the collaborative arrangements do not include a right of return for any deliverable as part of the accounting for these arrangements the group must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract in developing the stand alone selling price for a performance obligation the group considers competitor pricing for a similar or identical product market awareness of and perception of the product expected product life and current market trends in general the consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when the respective obligation is satisfied either by delivering a good or providing a service limited to the consideration that is not constrained when the timing of the delivery of product is different from the timing of payments made by the customers the group recognizes either a contract asset performance precedes the contractual due date or a contract liability customer payment precedes performance the group 146 s contractual payment terms are typically due in no more than 30 days from invoicing in limited situations certain customer contractual payment terms require the group to bill in arrears thus the group satisfies some or all of the performance obligations before the group is contractually table of contents entitled to bill the customer in these situations billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition which results in a contract asset for example certain of the contractual arrangements do not permit the group to bill until the completion of the production of the samples in other limited situations certain customer contractual payment terms allow the group to bill in advance thus the group receives customer cash payment before satisfying some or all of its performance obligations in these situations billing occurs in advance of revenue recognition which results in contract liabilities licenses of intellectual property upfront non refundable payments for licensing the group 146 s intellectual property are evaluated to determine if the license is distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement for licenses determined to be distinct the group recognizes revenues from non refundable up front fees allocated to the license at a point in time when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license research and development services the portion of the transaction price allocated to research and development services performance obligations is deferred and recognized as collaboration revenue over time as delivery or performance of such services occurs milestone payments at the inception of each arrangement that includes development commercialization and regulatory milestone payments the group evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and to the extent that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur in future periods estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method the transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand alone selling price basis for which the group recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied at the end of each subsequent reporting period the group re evaluates the probability of achieving such development milestones and any related constraint and if necessary adjust the estimate of the overall transaction price any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch up basis which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment royalties for arrangements that include sales based royalties including milestone payments based on the level of sales and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate the group recognizes revenue at the later of i when the related sales occur or ii when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied 2 11 research and development expenses elements of research and development expenses primarily include 1 payroll and other related expenses of personnel engaged in research and development activities 2 in licensed patent rights fee of exclusive development rights of drugs granted to the group 3 expenses related to preclinical testing of the group 146 s technologies under development and clinical trials such as payments to contract research organizations 147 cro 148 investigators and clinical trial sites that conduct the clinical studies 4 expenses to develop the product candidates including raw materials and supplies product testing depreciation and facility related expenses 5 other research and development expenses research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred when these expenditures relate to the group 146 s research and development services and have no alternative future uses the group has acquired rights to develop and commercialize product candidates upfront payments that relate to the acquisition of a new drug compound as well as pre commercial milestone payments are immediately expensed as acquired in process research and development in the period in which they are incurred provided that the new drug compound did not also include processes or activities that would constitute a 147 business 148 as defined under u s gaap the drug has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and absent obtaining such approval has no established alternative future use milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval would be capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the related product the conditions enabling capitalization of development expenses as an asset have not yet been met and therefore all development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss when incurred table of contents 2 12 leases prior to the adoption of asc 842 on january 1 2019 leases mainly leases of offices where substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets remain with the lessor are accounted for as operating leases payments made under operating leases are recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term the group had no capital leases for any of the years stated herein upon and hereafter the adoption of asc 842 on january 1 2019 the group determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception operating leases are included in operating lease right of use 147 rou 148 assets operating lease liability and operating lease liability non current in the group 146 s consolidated balance sheets rou assets represent the group 146 s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the group 146 s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term when determining the lease term the group includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option if any as the group 146 s leases do not provide an implicit rate the group uses its incremental borrowing rate which it calculates based on the credit quality of the group and by comparing interest rates available in the market for similar borrowings and adjusting this amount based on the impact of collateral over the term of each lease the group has elected to adopt the following lease policies in conjunction with the adoption of asu 2016 02 i elect for each lease not to separate non lease components from lease components and instead to account for each separate lease component and the non lease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component ii for leases that have lease terms of 12 months or less and does not include a purchase option that is reasonably certain to exercise the group elected not to apply asc 842 recognition requirements and iii the group elected to apply the package of practical expedients for existing arrangements entered into prior to january 1 2019 to not reassess a whether an arrangement is or contains a lease b the lease classification applied to existing leases and c initial direct costs 2 13 share based compensation the company grants restricted shares and stock options to eligible employees and accounts for share based compensation in accordance with asc 718 compensation 151 stock compensation employees 146 share based compensation awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the awards and recognized as expenses a immediately at the grant date if no vesting conditions are required or b for share based awards granted with only service conditions using the graded vesting method net of estimated forfeitures over the vesting period or c for share based awards granted with service conditions and the occurrence of an initial public offering 147 ipo 148 as performance condition cumulative share based compensation expenses for the options that have satisfied the service condition should be recorded upon the completion of the ipo using the graded vesting method a change in any of the terms or conditions of share based awards is accounted for as a modification of the awards the group calculates incremental compensation expense of a modification as the excess of the fair value of the modified awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before its terms are modified at the modification date for vested awards the group recognizes incremental compensation cost in the period when the modification occurs for awards not being fully vested the group recognizes the sum of the incremental compensation expense and the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for the original awards over the remaining requisite service period after modification share based compensation in relation to the restricted shares is measured based on the fair market value of the group 146 s ordinary shares at the grant date of the award prior to the listing estimation of the fair value of the group 146 s ordinary shares involves significant assumptions that might not be observable in the market and a number of complex and subjective variables including discount rate and subjective judgments regarding the group 146 s projected financial and operating results its unique business risks the liquidity of its ordinary shares and its operating history and prospects at the time the grants are made share based compensation in relation to the share options is table of contents estimated using the binominal option pricing model the determination of the fair value of share options is affected by the share price of the group 146 s ordinary shares as well as the assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including the expected share price volatility risk free interest rate exercise multiple and expected dividend yield the fair value of these awards was determined with the assistance from an independent valuation firm 2 14 adopted accounting pronouncements in 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016 02 leases topic 842 this asu requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms

credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments 147 asu 2016 13 148 this guidance requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount

volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable peer public companies with a time horizon close to the expected term of the group 146 s options the risk free interest rate was estimated based on the yield to maturity of u s treasury bonds denominated in us for a term consistent with the expected term of the group 146 s options in effect at the option valuation date the expected exercise multiple was estimated as the average ratio of the stock price to the exercise price when employees would decide to voluntarily exercise their vested options as the group did not have sufficient information of past employee exercise history it was estimated by referencing to a widely accepted academic research publication expected dividend yield is zero as the group has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its shares and the group does not anticipate any dividend payments in the foreseeable future expected term is the contract life of the option there were 640 000 stock options granted to employees under 2017 plan for the nine months ended september 30 2019 since the exercisability is dependent upon the listing and it is not probable that this performance

september 30 2019 exercisable as of september 30 2019 stock options granted to certain directors and employees of the group were measured at fair value on the dates of grant using the binomial option pricing model with the following assumptions nine months ended september 30 2019 expected volatility risk free interest rate per annum exercise multiple expected dividend yield contractual term in years the expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable peer public companies with a time horizon close to the expected term of the group 146 s options the risk free interest rate was estimated based on the yield to maturity of u s treasury bonds denominated in us for a term consistent with the expected term of the table of contents group 146 s options in effect at the option valuation date the expected exercise multiple was estimated as the average ratio of the stock price to the exercise price when employees would decide to voluntarily exercise their vested options as the group did not have sufficient information of past employee exercise history it was estimated by referencing to a widely accepted academic research publication expected dividend yield is zero as the group has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its shares and the group does not anticipate any dividend payments in the foreseeable future expected term is the contract life of the option except for the aforementioned grant of stock options to a director of the group under 2018 plan since the exercisability is dependent upon the listing and it is not probable that this performance condition can be achieved until a listing no share based compensation expense related to the 2018 plan was recorded for the nine months ended september 30 2019 the group will recognize compensation expenses relating to options vested cumulatively upon the completion of the company 146 s listing d repurchase of share awards held by a director on february 22 2019 the amended

achievements of milestones are constrained such that the transaction price shall initially only include upfront payment and subsequently once another milestone was achieved that means when uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved the additional milestone payment shall be included in the total transaction price when it is no longer probable that a significant

2018 and is expected to grow to rmb2 0 trillion in 2023 growth in china s residential rental market is mainly driven by the following factors continued urbanization high housing prices particularly in tier 1 and tier 2 cities changes in young people s consumption habits and lifestyle favorable policies supporting the residential rental market table of contents most of the residential rental properties in china are still owned and operated by individual property owners property owners and renters suffer from numerous pain points as illustrated below property owners inefficient rental a result there are massive opportunities for co living platforms that centralize the leasing and operation of rental properties in particular affordability is the biggest issue for young renters today particularly in tier 1 and tier 2 cities in the conventional residential rental market the smallest unit available for rent is often an entire apartment as individual property owners are generally unable or otherwise unwilling to bear the burden and risk of renting out private rooms co living platforms reduce the smallest unit available for rent to a private room thereby providing an affordable alternative for instance danke enables renters to enjoy substantial savings by offering private rooms at less than half of the price of renting a studio or one bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood in beijing in the nine months ended september 30 2019 average monthly rent in beijing 1 average monthly rent for a studio or one bedroom apartment in the six urban districts of beijing namely haidian chaoyang dongcheng xicheng fengtai and shijingshan 2 average monthly rent for danke s private room with shared common space such as living room kitchen and bathroom in the six urban districts of beijing mentioned above source iresearch table of contents co living platforms are rapidly gaining popularity in china benefiting from the sharing economy online consumption consumption upgrade and increasing acceptance by property owners properties operated by co living platforms offering standardized renovation furnishing and services only accounted for approximately 2 of all residential rental properties in china as of december 31 2018 in the united states and japan the percentage of renovated or serviced rental apartments operated by institutions was around 57 and 80 respectively this presents an enormous growth potential for co living platforms in china co living platforms achieve scale they accumulate a large captive pool of renters to whom value added services can be provided typical renters spend more than ten hours each day at home and during their stay they may demand a wide range of services including cleaning repair and maintenance laundry relocation food delivery smart home and online insurance among others these services represented a nearly rmb2 4 trillion market in china in 2018 according to iresearch see china s overall residential rental market as our total addressable market and residential rental market in tier 1 and tier 2 cities as our serviceable addressable market we see the provision of value added services to renters as an incremental opportunity beyond that presented by the residential rental market we have created a vibrant ecosystem our data technology and apartment network serve as the basis of our ecosystem which bring in and connect the key stakeholders in our ecosystem 151 property owners residents and third party service providers the interaction among these stakeholders forms a virtuous cycle which brings

needs of our residents with our data analytics and help third party service providers reach and acquire their target users with personalized services we also create a feedback loop between residents and third party service providers and help build valuable customer relationships with increased we aim to operate our business so that each new apartment unit is accretive to our long term financial performance after we sign new leases with the property owners we need to invest in renovating and furnishing the newly sourced apartment units which generally takes 17 21 days before they are ready for renting to our residents before an apartment unit is filled we incur leasing cost to the property owner in addition to initial investment without generating revenues fill our ready to move in apartment units leveraging our sales and marketing efforts after we rent out a unit we start collecting rents and service fees from our resident generating a recurring stream of revenues and cash flows at this point the net cash flows shift from outgoing to incoming as we generate revenues over each period after the apartment unit is filled the cumulative incoming cashflow will allow us to recover our initial investment after a certain period of time and start realizing returns from such apartment unit we refer to the amount of time required to recover the initial capital investment for the apartment units sourced in a given period as payback period it is calculated as the average cost for renovation and furnishing per unit for such period divided by the average rental spread for such period from the first quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2019 the payback period for the apartment units sourced in each quarter typically ranged between 12 to 20 months as we expand our scale we will be able to improve our cost efficiency further enhance our return and shorten our payback period typically sign leases for four to six years with property owners to lock in favorable terms and asset exclusivity and one year leases with our residents we are therefore able to lock in stable leasing cost over the terms of the leases with property owners and enjoy potential upside from rent increase on the resident side in addition as we introduce more value added services to our residents we will continue to increase the overall lifetime value of each of our apartment unit intend to continue to deploy capital to grow and source new apartment units since we are currently in a rapid growth stage we expect to continue to incur upfront investment for our newly sourced apartment units as a higher percentage of our apartment units pass their pay back period over time we believe that our profitability profile will continue to improve table of contents we believe the following competitive strengths are key drivers of our success and set us apart from our competitors our strategies we intend to further grow our business and reinforce our leading market position by

with the most current information that we are able to provide under the time constraints the below summary of financial data is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for october 2019 or october 2018 because our 2019 fiscal year has only recently concluded we are still in the process of completing our annual financial statements therefore it is possible that normal annual adjustments will be made revenues our revenues were rmb713 3 million us 99 8 million in october 2019 an increase of 124 0 from rmb318 5 million in october 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of opened apartment units as a result of the continued expansion of our business rental cost our rental cost was rmb642 8 million us 89 9 million in october 2019 an increase of 146 1 from rmb261 2 million in october 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of opened apartment units as we continued to expand our business our rental cost as a percentage of our revenues increased from 82 0 in october 2018 to 90 1 in october 2019 primarily because we conducted one off promotional activities in october 2019 depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization were rmb112 5 million us 15 7 million in october 2019 an increase of 169 8 from rmb41 7 million in october 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of apartment units we renovated and opened other operating expenses our other operating expenses were rmb64 6 million us 9 0 million in october 2019 an increase of 65 2 from rmb39 1 million in october 2018 the increase was primarily due to increased cost of services as we operated more apartment units and increased incentives for apartment sourcing as we incurred additional commissions and lead generation fees in sourcing more apartments pre opening expense our pre opening expense was rmb18 3 million us 2 6 million in october 2019 a decrease of 21 5 from rmb23 3 million in october 2018 the decrease was primarily attributable to a lower number of pre opening apartment units in october 2019 as compared to october 2018 as we strategically sourced a large number of apartment units in the fourth quarter of 2018 sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses were rmb98 2 million us 13 7 million in october 2019 an increase of 82 9 from rmb53 7 million in october 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses as we enhanced our advertising efforts and an increase in incentives for apartment renting as we incurred additional commissions and lead generation fees in renting out our apartment units general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were rmb32 2 million us 4 5 million in october 2019 an increase of 8 8 from rmb29 6 million table of contents october 2018 the increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel for general corporate functions technology and product development expenses our technology and product development expenses were rmb17 4 million us 2 4 million in october 2019 an increase of 112 2 from rmb8 2 million in october 2018 the increase was primarily due to the expansion of our technology team with additional experienced research and development personnel to develop our technology system and improve our product and service offerings interest expenses our interest expenses were rmb28 1 million us 3 9 million in october 2019 an increase of 47 9 from rmb19 0 million in october 2018 the increase was primarily because we borrowed additional bank loans to a lesser extent the increase was attributable to an increase in interest expenses related to rent financing which was driven by the increase in the number of residents who opted for rent financing as we rented out more apartment units net loss our net loss was rmb296 6 million us 41 5 million in october 2019 as compared to rmb152 9 million in october 2018 adjusted net loss our adjusted net loss which

november 30 2019 as compared to 86 9 as of september 30 2019 the decrease was primarily due to seasonality and the fact that we adjusted our sales and marketing strategies in the fourth quarter of 2019 which we believe will improve our sales and marketing efficiency in the long run the average revenues per rented out unit per month for october 2019 were rmb2 064 as compared to rmb2 332 for

september 30 2019 was primarily driven by the rapid expansion of our apartment network table of contents an investment in our adss involves significant risks you should consider carefully all of the information in this prospectus including the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment in our adss any of the following risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and ability to pay dividends and you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to our business and industry we have a limited operating history in a rapidly evolving market which makes it difficult to evaluate our results of operations and future prospects in particular our historical growth may not be indicative of our future growth we commenced operations in january 2015 and have a limited operating history we operate in china s residential rental market which is a rapidly evolving market and have experienced rapid growth our total revenues increased significantly by 307 3 from rmb656 8 million in 2017 to rmb2 675 0 million us 374 3 million in 2018 and increased by 198 8 from rmb1 673 0 million in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to rmb4 999 7 million us 699 5 million in the nine months ended september 30 2019 the number of apartment units we operated increased from 2 434 as of december 31 2015 to 236 420 as of december 31 2018 representing a cagr of 359 7 this number further increased to 406 746 as of september 30 2019 however our strong historical growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth and we may not be able to generate similar growth rates in future periods for instance we expect our revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be modest compared with our growth in prior quarters this is primarily because we adjusted our sales and marketing strategies in the fourth quarter of 2019 which we believe will improve our sales and marketing efficiency in the long run our growth rates may decline for a number of possible reasons some of which are beyond our control including decreasing disposable income increasing competition declining growth of china s residential rental market the emergence of alternative business models changes in rules regulations government policies or general economic conditions in addition we operate under an innovative new rental business model which may not develop as we expect it is difficult to evaluate our prospects as we may not have sufficient experience in addressing the risks to which companies operating in rapidly evolving markets may be exposed if our growth rate declines investors perceptions of our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected and the market price of the adss could decline if we fail to effectively execute our strategies manage our growth or control our expenses our business results of operations financial condition and prospects could be harmed our business growth depends on our ability to effectively execute our expansion strategies and increase the number of apartment units we operate there can be no assurance that we will be able to source more apartments from additional property owners to expand our apartment network in our existing cities and new cities or that the existing property owners will renew their leases with us at the expiration of the lease terms failure to maintain or expand our apartment network would restrict our growth and materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition ability to retain existing residents and attract new residents in a cost effective and timely manner is also critical to our growth as we generate revenues primarily from the rents and service fees we charge our residents our existing residents may not continue to lease our apartment units if we fail to provide satisfactory residential experience we may also lose our existing residents due to reasons beyond our control such as changes in our residents personal or financial condition or lower rents offered by our competitors or individual property owners in addition we may not be successful in table of contents new residents if we fail to provide attractive apartment units at reasonable prices or expand our service offerings to meeting their evolving needs if we fail to maintain or expand our resident base our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected addition our rapid growth will place significant demand on our management operational and financial resources we expect our costs and expenses to continue to increase in the future as we increase the number of apartments we operate serve more property owners and residents upgrade our renovation and furnishing solutions and provide new services in addition our operating expenses such as our labor related expenses and sales and marketing expenses have grown rapidly as we expanded our business and we expect to continue to incur increasing operating expenses to support our anticipated future growth to manage our growth and expansion we also plan to continue to invest in our technology infrastructure to further increase our operational efficiency we will also need to further expand train manage and motivate our workforce and manage our relationships with stakeholders in our ecosystem including property owners residents and third party service providers all of these endeavors involve risks and will require substantial management efforts and skills and significant additional expenditures our further expansion may divert our management operational technological and financial resources from our existing business operations or we may fail to implement our growth strategies which could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and prospects we have incurred net loss and negative cash flow from operating activities in the past and we may continue to experience losses and negative cash flow from operating activities in the future we incurred net losses of rmb271 5 million rmb1 369 7 million us 191 6 million and rmb2 516 2 million us 352 0 million in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 respectively we had negative cash flow from operating activities of rmb114 6 million rmb1 164 2 million us 162 9 million and rmb1 629 3 million us 227 9 million in the same periods respectively we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate net profits or positive cash flow from operating activities in the future our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and generate positive cash flow from operating activities will depend in large part on our ability to among other things expand our apartment network increase the number of our residents maintain healthy occupancy rate and optimize our cost structure we may not be able to achieve any of the above we intend to continue to invest heavily for the foreseeable future in expanding our apartment network improving the quality of our apartments expanding our service offerings and developing our technology system to support our growth these expenditures might make it difficult for us to achieve profitability or generate positive cash flow from operating activities and we cannot predict whether we will be able to do so in the near term or at all we also expect to incur additional sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses as we grow our operating expenses and other expenses may be greater than we anticipate and our investments to make our business and our operations more efficient may not be successful we may be unable to achieve profitability and may face challenges in managing our our business requires significant capital to expand our apartment network and renovate and furnish our apartments inability to obtain capital through financing or other sources on favorable terms in a timely manner or at all would materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and growth prospects we need significant capital to make continued investments in various aspects of our business operations in order to remain competitive we generally incur substantial upfront capital outlay before we start to generate revenues on the relevant apartments this includes capital outlay for sourcing and leasing apartments from property owners and renovation and furnishing of the apartments as necessary to make them suitable for lease out to residents we also incur ongoing expenditures in repair table of contents cleaning and other services including but not limited to repair or replacement of furniture fixtures and appliances and making other leasehold improvements if we are unable to obtain capital through financing or other sources on favorable terms and in a timely manner we may be unable to expand as planned or maintain consistent quality of our apartments as a result we may lose market share to our competitors and our occupancy rates may decline which would materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and growth prospects significant sources of our capital include upfront payment from financial institutions in connection with rent financing and advance from our residents as of december 31 2017 2018 and september 30 2019 we had upfront payment from financial institutions of rmb937 6 million rmb2 127 0 million us 297 6 million and rmb3 105 7 million us 434 5 million respectively and advance from our residents of rmb105 7 million rmb279 5 million us 39 1 million and rmb794 3 million us 111 1 million respectively 91 3 75 8 and 67 9 of the residents who had valid leases with us in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 had rent financing arrangements with us in the respective periods indicated we will need to return the upfront payment for the remaining lease terms to the financial institutions or relevant residents as applicable in the event of early termination of the leases or defaults by the residents on loan repayment in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 the total amount of upfront payment that we returned to financial institutions in the event of early termination of the leases or defaults by the residents on loan repayment was rmb436 6 million rmb1 757 1 million us 245 8 million and rmb1 759 4 million us 246 1 million respectively we were able to re rent the relevant apartment units and generate working capital in a relatively short time frame thus minimizing adverse impact on our liquidity however if we are required to return a significant portion of the upfront payment within a short time period there will be constraints on our working capital and we may need to seek alternative sources of capital which may not be available in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to obtain significant capital through rent financing for instance the opinion on rectifying and regulating the order of the residential rental market or the opinion which became effective on december 13 2019 requires that a residential rental company such as us shall make sure that the amount of payment it receives through rent financing does not exceed 30 of the rental income of such company by the end of 2022 see regulation 151 regulations on real estate leasing services 151 general regulations on housing leasing while we plan to reduce such ratio to below 30 by the end of 2021 we cannot assure you that we would be able to meet the requirement of the opinion within the required timeframe or that our business operations cash flow or financial condition would not be negatively affected can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain capital through financing or other sources on favorable terms in a timely manner or at all for example while we are exploring various other types of financing such as supply chain financing we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure such financing or reach an agreement on financing terms with banks or other relevant parties due to reasons beyond our control such as economic recession or tightening of credit market if debt financing is not available we may need to raise additional funds through issuance of equity securities in which case the ownership interests of our shareholders could be significantly diluted and the newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders furthermore we may not be able to raise funds through issuance of equity securities if at all the lease term with property owners is longer than the lease term with residents and corporate clients which subjects us to risk of fluctuations in market rent and vacancy risk and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the long term nature of our leases with our property owners and the relatively shorter terms of our leases with our residents or corporate clients may subject us to certain risks for danke apartment we generally enter into four to six year leases with property owners and one year leases with residents for dream apartment we typically sign leases on a ten year term with property owners table of contents leases on one or two year term with corporate clients due to the mismatch between the lease terms with property owners on the one hand and residents or corporate clients on the other hand our revenues may be materially and adversely affected if a decline in market rental rates renders us unable to rent out our apartments to our residents or corporate clients at rental rates higher than what we pay to the property owners additionally since the lease terms of our residents and corporate clients are shorter than those of the property owners we may be subject to vacancy risk if our residents or corporate clients do not renew their leases or if we fail to find new residents or corporate clients to cover the remainder of the lease terms of our leases with the property owners we may also need to incur sales and marketing expenses to acquire succeeding residents or corporate clients some of our apartments employ the n 1 model which may be viewed as not in compliant with existing regulations and may violate new laws regulations or policies pursuant to the administrative measures on leasing of commodity housing or the administrative measures issued by the ministry of housing and urban rural development or mohurd a residential rental unit for lease shall not be smaller than an individual room under the original design in the event of non compliance competent government authorities may force the relevant person to restore the property to its original condition and may impose a fine ranging from rmb5 000 to rmb30 000 for any such violation in addition according to the real estate brokerage management methods real estate brokerage entities and brokers are prohibited from modifying the structure of residential rental properties for leasing purpose competent government authorities may impose a fine of rmb30 000 on the real estate brokerage entities and rmb10 000 on the real estate brokers for any such violation and may force the relevant entity or broker to restore the property to its original condition convert some of the apartment units we operate from living rooms which is known as the n 1 model although we take measures to make sure that such apartment units comply with the requirements for the minimum per capita floor area imposed by the relevant local governments it is uncertain whether the administrative measures or the real estate brokerage management methods can be interpreted as prohibiting the n 1 model in 2017 the ministry of commerce proposed the administrative regulations on house leasing and sale consultation draft or the consultation draft which provides that living rooms can be partitioned for leasing purposes as long as certain requirements are met however such consultation draft has not been adopted yet due to the ambiguity of the relevant provisions under the administrative measures and the real estate brokerage management methods and lack of clear guidance from mohurd local governments may have different interpretations of these provisions we cannot assure you that any such local government will not interpret these provisions in a manner that renders our n 1 model non compliant for instance we were fined for operating some apartment units under the n 1 model and requested to restore such apartment units to original conditions by the local government authorities in beijing in addition local governments in the cities where we operate or may operate in the future may issue new rules that prohibit or restrict our n 1 model if we were deemed to have violated laws regulations and policies prohibiting the n 1 model we might be subject to penalties and might be required to restore the non compliant apartment units to original conditions and relocate the residents staying in such apartment units we might even need to adjust our business model which would have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and growth prospects the residential rental market is highly competitive and we face competition in several major aspects of our business if we fail to compete successfully against our current or future competitors our business results of operations financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected we face strong competition in our business our competitors include among others i other co living platforms ii traditional real estate agents iii real estate developers that rent out their own properties and iv hotel and serviced apartment operators with the influx of new entrants and the table of contents of current participants we expect competition in our industry to continue and intensify which could harm our ability to increase revenues and attain or sustain profitability the aspects of our business where we face competition include competition in acquiring and retaining property owners and residents provision of attractive apartments and services and advertising and marketing activities some of our competitors have more resources and longer operating history or are better capitalized than us our competitors may successfully attract residents with cheaper apartments in more convenient locations better incentives amenities and value added services which could adversely affect our ability to obtain quality residents and rent out our apartment units on terms that are favorable to us in addition our competitors may have better access to property owner and resident information which helps them identify and acquire quality apartment and residents more quickly may result in fewer apartments available to us higher rental rates to be paid by us to property owners and difficulties in acquiring and retaining residents we may be required to spend additional resources to further enhance our brand recognition and promote our services and such additional spending could adversely affect our profitability furthermore if we are involved in disputes with any of our competitors that result in negative publicity to us such disputes regardless of their veracity or outcome may harm our reputation or brand image we are highly dependent on our technology system our technology system may contain undetected errors or ineffective algorithm or may experience unexpected system failure interruption inadequacy security breaches or cyber attacks our reputation business and results of operations may be materially harmed by service disruptions or by our failure to timely and effectively upgrade and our existing technology and infrastructure our business relies heavily on our technology system including our proprietary artificial intelligence decision engine 151 danke brain our big data platform and it infrastructure which work seamlessly together as the backbone of our business we are highly dependent on the ability of such technology system to process and manage immense amounts of data and make decisions to guide each step of our operational process our technology system may contain undetected error or bugs or ineffective algorithm which may result in inaccurate estimate or decisions and thus materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example we rely on danke brain to estimate rental price for our residents renovation cost and the deal terms we offer to property owners if danke brain makes any mistake in making such estimate and calculations we may offer pricing terms that are less favorable to us or incur unnecessary cost which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we derive valuable insights from danke brain in planning our city level and neighborhood level expansion any inaccurate analytics by danke brain could result in failures of our expansion strategies have benefited from the fact that the type of proprietary technology system equivalent to which we employ has not been widely available to our competitors if our technology becomes widely available to our current or future competitors for any reason our operating results may be adversely affected also any adoption or development of similar or more advanced technologies by our competitors may require that we devote substantial resources to the development of more advanced technology to remain competitive additionally to keep pace with changing technologies and residents demands we should correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our technology system in response to these trends which may lead to significant research and development costs we may be unable to accurately determine the needs of our residents or the trends in the residential rental market or to design and implement the appropriate features and functionality of our technology in a timely and cost effective manner which could result in decreased demand for our products and services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues we may not be able to keep up with rapid changes of technology develop new technology realize a return on amounts invested in developing new technologies or remain competitive in the future table of contents technology infrastructure may encounter disruptions or other outages caused by problems or defects in our technology system such as malfunctions in software or network overload our technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption caused by telecommunication failures power loss human error or other accidents despite of any precautionary measures we may take the occurrence of unanticipated problems that affect our technology infrastructure could result in interruptions in the availability of our services it may be difficult for us to respond to such interruptions in a timely manner or at all such interruptions would damage our reputation reduce our future revenues harm our future profits subject us to regulatory scrutiny and cause our customers to seek alternative solutions furthermore our physical infrastructure is also vulnerable to damages from fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters power loss and telecommunication failures any network interruption or inadequacy that causes interruptions to our operations or failure to maintain the network and server or solve such problems in a timely manner could reduce our customer satisfaction which in turn could adversely affect our reputation business and financial condition our failure to maintain the quality and safety of our apartments could damage our brand image and negatively affect our results of operations under the relevant prc laws regulations and technical standards we are required to ensure that our apartments meet certain environmental standards including the air quality and environmental protection standards for preventing the indoor environmental hazards generated by construction materials and decorative building materials we may also be required to comply with various fire health life safety and similar laws and regulations we may be subject to civil liabilities or administrative penalties for our failure to comply with environmental construction fire or other laws or regulations in addition under the prc laws if the leased residential property imposes a threat to the safety or health of the resident the resident is entitled to terminate the lease at any time although we have taken measures to avoid environmental and fire hazards including testing air quality after renovation and taking fire precaution measures we cannot assure you that our residents will not raise any health or safety claims in addition we cannot assure you that future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose more stringent environmental or fire safety requirement or that the current environmental condition of our apartments will not be affected by the activities of residents existing conditions of the land operations in the vicinity of the apartments or the activities of unrelated third parties although we have taken measures to protect the safety of our residents including installing each apartment unit with digital door lock and conducting background check of our residents before signing leases with them there could still be safety incidents particularly in apartments in which the private rooms are rented to different residents personal injuries or property losses suffered by our residents or other disputes between our residents or between our residents and other third parties could expose us to legal liability harm our reputation result in resident attrition and adversely affect our business and results of operations our business is dependent on the strengths of our brand and reputation if we fail to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation as a result of our actions or the actions of third parties or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected our business and financial performance depends on the strength and the market acceptance of our brand we have established a strong brand name and reputation in china any loss of trust in our products and services could harm the value of our brand which could materially reduce our revenues and profitability from time to time we organize marketing campaigns and work with media partners to promote our brand and our products and service offerings which may cause us to substantially increase our marketing expenditures we cannot assure you however that these activities will be successful or that we will be able to achieve the promotional effect we expect table of contents brand and reputation are vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries or investigations lawsuits and other claims in the ordinary course of our business perceptions of conflicts of interest complaints made by our residents and market rumors among other things could substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or fully addressed for instance to protect the safety of our residents we conduct background check of potential residents who seek to rent our apartment units and may refuse to rent our apartment units to certain potential residents which may lead to potential disputes or complaints and may in turn harm our brand and reputation our brand and reputation could also be harmed by the unauthorized illegal or immoral conduct of our employees dispatched workers or third party service providers we collaborate with addition any negative media publicity about our platform or our industry in general may also negatively impact our brand and reputation if we are unable to maintain our reputation enhance our brand recognition or promote our product and service offerings or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and growth prospects may be materially and adversely early termination or breach of the leases by a significant number of property owners may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations property owners may terminate the lease agreements with us before the end of their terms for various reasons if the lease with a property owner is terminated before expiration or if a property owner breaches the lease making the apartment no longer available we would have to terminate our lease with the relevant resident or corporate client for danke apartment we will need to return the balance of the upfront payment to such resident or to the financial institution that provide rent financing to such resident as the case may be which would negatively affect our cash flow alternatively we would facilitate the resident to relocate to our other apartment unit in either way we may incur additional costs and expenses and may cause resident dissatisfaction in addition although our leases generally provide that property owners shall pay a penalty to both us and our residents or corporate clients for early termination and also compensate us for pro rata renovation cost the penalty and compensation may not be sufficient to cover our loss or may be lowered if the court deems the penalty prescribed under our lease agreements to be unfair there can be no assurance that we are able to receive fair compensation for our losses and our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected if a significant number of our property owners seek early terminations if our residents or corporate clients seek early termination of their leases or fail to meet their obligations under their leases our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected our residents or corporate clients may seek early termination of their leases or fail to meet their obligations in connection with the leases for example residents or corporate clients may default on rental payments or residents may default on repayment of rental installment loans if a resident defaults on his her payment obligations and fails to cure the default within the applicable grace period we may terminate the lease and repossess the apartment pursuant to the lease and relevant prc laws we also need to return prepaid rents to the relevant resident or financial institution as applicable which might have negative impact on our cash flow similarly if a corporate client defaults on its rental payment and fails to cure the default within the applicable grace period we have the right to terminate the lease and repossess the apartment in the event of lease breach or early termination we may not be able to find a new resident or corporate client to fill the vacancy in a timely manner under the same terms or at all and the security deposit or penalty of the defaulting resident or corporate client may not be sufficient to cover our losses for the period in between the leases our business results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if a significant number of our residents table of contents corporate clients seek early termination nor fail to meet their obligations in connection with the lease addition residents may use our apartments for illegal purposes or engage in illegal activities in our apartments damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our apartments refuse to leave the apartments upon default or termination of the lease disturb nearby residents with noise trash odors or eyesores sublet our apartments in violation of our lease or permit unauthorized persons to live in our apartments although we have the right to terminate the leases under such circumstances and the residents are responsible for damages caused by their wrongful conduct we may still suffer from negative impact on our business and reputation damage to our apartments may delay re leasing necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental income of the apartments resulting in a lower than expected rate of return we may face challenges regarding our cooperation with financial institutions in offering rent financing we cooperate with licensed financial institutions which offer rent financing to certain of our residents under such arrangement the financial institutions perform credit assessment on the residents who opt for rent financing and if approved will enter into financing agreements with these residents to ensure proper use of the funds the financial institutions will make upfront payment to us and the residents should repay the loan to the financial institutions in monthly installments pursuant to the financing agreements under our arrangements with certain financial institutions we are obligated to transfer part of the funds to a separate escrow account at such financial institutions in the event of an early termination of a resident s lease or a resident s default on repayment of monthly installments we would be required to return the upfront payment for the remaining lease term to the relevant financial institution which would cause a cash outflow and a reduction in our working capital we cannot fully predict when and how many of our residents will early terminate their leases or default on the loan repayment which makes our cash outflow unpredictable in the event of a substantial number of early terminations or defaults we may face cash flow shortage and our business operations and financial condition would be negatively affected utilize the upfront payment from the financial institutions to support our expansion we cannot assure you that the rent financing arrangement will not be challenged or further regulated by the competent governmental authorities for instance the opinion imposes certain new requirements on rent financing which may subject us to additional risks see 151 our business requires significant capital to expand our apartment network and renovate and furnish our apartments inability to obtain capital through financing or other sources on favorable terms in a timely manner or at all would materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and growth prospects we currently work with a limited number of financial institutions and we cannot assure you that such financial institutions will continue to cooperate with us on commercially favorable terms or at all or that existing or potential financial institutions will be able to sufficiently meet the rent financing needs of our residents if new laws regulations or rules are enacted to restrict or prohibit such arrangement or if any financial institution discontinues the cooperation with us for example as a result of its disqualification from engaging in financing business or default by a large number of residents we may need to find alternative sources of capital or seek alternative business arrangement failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and growth prospects pay interest on rent financing to the relevant financial institutions such arrangement may place a heavy strain on our financial resources and subject us to risks associated with an increase in interest rate if the number of residents who opt for rent financing increase significantly as we expand our resident base if we cease such arrangement due to a significant increase in interest rate or for other reasons potential residents may be unwilling to bear the interest expenses and may be less willing to rent our apartment units which could in turn negatively impact our business and results of operations table of contents our expansion into new markets may present increased risk we plan to enter new cities which we believe have strong growth potential such as cities with vibrant economic growth net inflow of migrants and favorable local polices on residential rental market however entering new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others inability to accurately evaluate local residential rental conditions and local economies inability to replicate our operation capability in the new markets lack of relevant prospective resident data relating to the new markets lack of brand recognition in new markets existing competitor in these markets who may already be existing market leaders inability to hire and retain key personnel in new markets lack of familiarity with local governmental policies and inability to achieve desirable financial results to succeed in new market may hamper our growth also since expansion into new market requires significant initial capital outlay failure to achieve targeted return in the new market could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may engage in business practices that violate prc laws and regulations and we may fail to obtain or maintain licenses and permits necessary to conduct our operations if we are deemed to have violated any prc laws and regulations or if we fail to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses and permits our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected our business is subject to various compliance and operational requirements under the prc laws and regulations some of which are ambiguous and constantly changing for instance the opinion has raised a series of compliance requirements for residential rental companies see regulation 151 regulations on real estate leasing services 151 general regulations on housing leasing local authorities may strengthen supervision over our business pursuant to this newly promulgated opinion as such there are substantial uncertainties regarding the evolution of the regulatory regime and the interpretation and implementation of current and any future prc laws and regulations applicable to the residential rental industry we may not be in full compliance with all of the applicable laws regulations and other requirements if we are deemed to have violated any prc laws and regulations we may be required to modify or even cease the non compliant practice we may also be subject to administrative penalties including the confiscation of illegal revenue fines and suspension of business operations which may have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our reputation example we have not withheld income taxes on behalf of the property owners for the rents we paid to them which may be deemed as in violation of individual income tax law and law on the administration of tax collection we may be subject to fines for such violation and may be required to take corrective measures two of our entities one that engages in construction design and the other that engages in subcontracting business have not obtained design permit construction enterprise qualification or safety production permit as required by the relevant prc laws and regulations we are in the process of applying for such permits and qualifications failure to do so in a timely manner may subject us to fines or we may be required by the relevant authority to take remedial action within a specified period of time or cease our construction projects which could cause a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations table of contents failure to maintain the quality of the services that we provide to our residents could harm our brand and reputation reduce resident satisfaction and cause resident attrition we provide one stop services to our residents including cleaning repair and maintenance wifi and 24 7 resident hotline we also plan to expand our service offerings to include additional value added services such as iot smart home moving services financial and insurance services new retail and other local services the quality of our services is one important factor that attracts our residents if we or our third party service providers fail to maintain the quality of the services we provide or fail to timely respond to residents request and offer fast and effective solutions our residents may become dissatisfied with us which in turn may result in resident attrition we may be subject to significant costs and reputational harm if our employees dispatched workers or third party service providers commit any misconduct or violate any laws or regulations during the course of our operations we have a large number of employees dispatched workers or third party service providers that are involved in our daily operations and serve our residents although we have implemented policies and procedures to govern their conducts there can be no assurance that they will not commit any misconduct or violate any laws or regulations during the course of our operations for instance they may make misrepresentations to our residents when renting out our apartment units cause personal injuries or property losses to our residents when performing cleaning or maintenance services inside their apartment units or breach our data policy any such incident may subject us to disputes or legal proceedings result in negative publicity and cause reputational harm to us any negative publicity including false rumors about us our business our operations our management our business partners or the residential rental market in general may materially and adversely affect our reputation business results of operations and growth prospects we have from time to time received negative publicity including negative internet and blog postings and news reportings on traditional media about our company our business our management or our services certain of such negative publicity may be the result of malicious harassment or unfair competition acts by third parties we may even be subject to government or regulatory investigation as a result of such third party conduct and may be required to spend significant time and incur substantial costs to defend ourselves against such third party conduct and we may not be able to conclusively refute each of the allegations within a reasonable period of time or at all our brand and reputation may be materially and adversely affected as a result of any negative publicity which in turn may cause us to lose market share property owners residents corporate clients and third party business partners in addition negative publicity about residential rental market or co living platforms in general may also materially and adversely harm customer confidence in us we depend on third parties for different aspects of our business and the services that we offer including but not limited to strategic partners financial institutions third party service providers and third party payment companies our business results of operations financial condition and reputation may be materially and adversely affected if the third parties do not continue to maintain their relationship with us or fail to provide services or products according to the terms of our contracts or otherwise below standard we currently cooperate and rely on a number of business partners in our daily operations for instance we cooperate with third party service providers which provide cleaning and maintenance services renovation partners which renovate our apartments licensed financial institutions which provide rent financing to our residents and commercial banks and third party payment companies which process rental payments for us pursuing establishing and maintaining relationships with our business partners requires significant time and resources if we cannot successfully pursue establish or maintain relationships with our business partners our business operations may be adversely affected in table of contents our agreements with our business partners generally do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or offering competing services our competitors may be more effective in providing incentives to our business partners which may cause our business partners to favor business relationship with them over their relationship with us and devote more resources toward our competitors moreover our business partners may devote more resources to support their own competing businesses which may compete with our business and adversely affect our business relationship with these business partners furthermore if our business partners fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them we may have disagreements or disputes with them or suspend or terminate our business relationship which could adversely affect our business operations and brand image if our relationship with any of our existing business partners is suspended or terminated we may not be able to find replacement business partners in a timely and cost effective manner or at all which could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations business partners may be subject to regulatory penalties or punishments because of their regulatory compliance failures or may be infringing upon other parties legal rights which may directly or indirectly disrupt our business although we conduct review of legal formalities and certifications before entering into contractual relationships with third parties and take measures to reduce the risks that we may be exposed to in case of any non compliance by third parties we cannot be certain whether such third party has violated any regulatory requirements or infringed or will infringe any other parties legal rights we cannot rule out the possibility of incurring liabilities or suffering losses due to any non compliance by third parties we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify irregularities or non compliance in the business practices of third parties we conduct business with or that such irregularities or non compliance will be corrected in a prompt and proper manner any legal liabilities and regulatory actions affecting third parties involved in our business may affect our business activities and reputation and may in turn affect our business results of operations and financial condition addition we cannot guarantee that all the service providers will always adhere to our standards for quality of services or that our residents experience with such third party service providers will always be positive any poor performance of third parties involved in our business could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to retain and acquire residents we may not be able to effectively control the timing quality and costs relating to the renovation and furnishing of our apartments which may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our success depends on our ability to quickly renovate furnish and rent out apartments with high quality and in a cost effective and efficient manner nearly all of our apartments require some level of renovation when we lease them from property owners we are exposed to risks inherent in apartment renovation and furnishing including but not limited to potential cost overruns increases in labor and materials costs delays in renovation work and poor workmanship potential supply chain interruptions such as failure of our oems to timely manufacture our self designed furniture or failure of our suppliers to deliver raw materials furniture or appliances on time may also delay our progress and increase our costs if we fail to complete renovation and furnishing within our schedule or if our timing and cost estimation for renovation and furnishing prove to be materially inaccurate our business results of operations financial condition and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected in addition if we fail to control the quality of renovation and lead to any potential complaints from or damages to our residents we could be exposed to material liability and be held responsible for damages fines or penalties and our reputation may suffer table of contents any accidents injuries diseases or death in our rental apartments may adversely affect our reputation and subject us to liabilities while we endeavor to provide our residents with high quality and safe living conditions there are inherent risks of accidents or injuries in our apartments one or more accidents or injuries such as fire accident injury or death due to any criminal behavior slip and fall or suicide in any of our apartments could subject us to disputes or legal proceedings adversely affect our reputation decrease our overall occupancy rate and increase our costs for taking additional measures to further improve the effectiveness of our safety addition if any fire accident occurs in any of our apartments that do not possess fire safety inspection certificate or if any incident occurs in apartments where the actual use and the designated land use are inconsistent there could be substantial negative publicity and may even trigger large scale government actions that impact all of our apartments which in turn will have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition a substantial majority of the furniture in our apartments are designed by us and manufactured by oems that we cooperate with any personal injuries or other accidents caused by quality issues of our furniture may subject us to potential lawsuits and liabilities our business is susceptible to changes in china s national and regional economic conditions and real estate market particularly residential rental market our business depends substantially on conditions of china s real estate market particularly the residential rental market demand for residential rental properties in china has grown steadily in recent years primarily driven by favorable trends in residential rental market including increase in rural to urban migration resulting from continued urbanization high residential property prices in tier 1 and tier 2 cities changes in the consumption habits of young people who tend to prefer renting over purchasing properties consumption upgrade leading to demand for better living experience and services and favorable government policies supporting the growth of residential rental market however there is no assurance that such favorable trend could sustain any severe or prolonged slowdown in china s economy any slowdown or discontinuation of urbanization in our target markets or any changes in government policies that restrain the development of residential rental market may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations economic downturn in china at large or in the cities we operate in could also result in a reduction of available apartments we could source from as fewer people may purchase properties for investment purpose or some property owners may have to sell their properties for liquidity in addition in the event of recession our potential residents or existing residents may choose cheaper rental options due to budget constraint or we may have to reduce our rent to prevent resident attrition which may result in our rent expense exceeding our revenues and would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the geographic concentration of our business operation may subject us to heightened risks in the event of adverse changes in regional economic condition or real estate market for instance the apartment units we operated in our top 3 cities beijing shanghai and hangzhou accounted for approximately 56 4 of the total number of apartment units we operated as of september 30 2019 if any of these cities undergoes recession in general economic condition or real estate market we may be unable to maintain our current operations in such cities which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition table of contents new laws regulations and policies may be promulgated to strengthen the regulation on residential rental market which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and growth prospect prc laws regulations and policies concerning residential rental market are developing and evolving although we have been taking measures to comply with the laws regulations and policies that are applicable to our business operations prc legislature or government authorities may promulgate new laws and regulations in the future that may impose more stringent requirements on us we cannot assure you that our practice would not be deemed to violate any new prc laws regulations or policies or that we are able to comply with any new prc laws regulations or policies without unreasonable efforts or expenses which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition instance if prc legislature or regulators promulgate or adopt new laws regulations and policies imposing requirements on the minimum number of days between completion of renovation and renting out our apartments we might be forced to keep our apartments vacant for a longer period of time which may adversely affect our results of operations addition government agencies may adopt policies intending to control rent levels which may adversely affect our revenues and profitability moreover we impose an automatic lock out of our residents through digital door locks in the event of rent delinquency for seven days or more although we believe that such policy does not violate any prc laws or regulations new laws or regulations may be enacted that impose restrictions on tenant eviction which may adversely affect our business our leasehold interest may be defective and our legal right to lease certain properties may be challenged which could cause significant disruption to our business under the prc laws and regulations all leases are required to be registered with the local authorities although failure to do so does not in itself invalidate the leases lessees may not be able to defend these leases against bona fide third parties and may also be exposed to potential fines if they fail to rectify such non compliance within the prescribed time frame after receiving notice from the relevant prc government authorities most of our leases including leases with property owners residents and corporate clients as well as leases for our offices and warehouses have not been registered as required which may expose us to potential fines ranging from rmb1 000 to rmb10 000 for each unregistered lease at the discretion of the relevant authority in the event that any fine is imposed on us for our failure to register our leases we may not be able to recover such losses from the contract counterparties some of our rights under the unregistered leases may also be subordinated to the rights of other interested third parties certain of our apartments have defects on the land use rights under the prc laws land shall be used strictly in line with the approved usage of the land unless the land alteration registration procedures are completed if any land is illegally used beyond the approved usage the land administrative departments of the prc government at and above the county level may force the property owner to complete the land alteration registration procedures within a time limit certain of our apartments are currently premised on the rural collectively owned land not on the land with a construction usage for dwelling house which is in contravention of the aforesaid legal requirements as a result the property owners of such apartments may be forced to go through the required procedures which may cause interruptions to our business operations and negatively affect our results of operations in addition some property owners of these apartments have not obtained ownership certificates and therefore our legal right to rent out such apartments may be challenged challenge to our legal rights to rent out the apartment units we operate if successful could impair the operations of such apartments we are also subject to the risk of potential disputes with property owners or third parties who claim their rights to or interests in the apartment we operate table of contents disputes whether resolved in our favor or not may divert management s attention harm our reputation or otherwise disrupt our business our business generates obtains and processes a large amount of data which subjects us to governmental regulations and other legal obligations and risks related to privacy information security use of data and data protection any improper use or disclosure of such data by us our employees or our business partners or theft by third parties could subject us to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in the ordinary course of our business we acquire and store sensitive data including our intellectual properties our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information such as names identification card numbers contacts and electronic signatures of property owners residents employees and third party service providers the secure processing and maintenance of such information is critical to our operations and business strategy our property owners residents employees and third party service providers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information are also required by applicable laws to keep strictly confidential the personal information that we collect and to take adequate security measures to safeguard the information we collect despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by computer hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other unauthorized access or disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed publicly disclosed misused lost or stolen because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our proprietary internal and third party data change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques security and privacy concerns have become an important legislative and rule making focus in china any unauthorized access disclosure misuse or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information regulatory penalties disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our results of operations reputation and competitive position our success depends on the continuing efforts of our key management and experienced and capable personnel as well as our ability to recruit new talents if we fail to hire train retain or motivate our staff our business may suffer our future success is significantly dependent upon the continued service of our key management as well as experienced and capable personnel generally our key management have been crucial to the development of our culture and strategic direction if we lose the services of any member of key management we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements and may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new staff which could severely disrupt our business and growth if any of our key management joins a competitor or forms a competing business we may lose customers know how and key professionals and staff members our management has entered into employment agreements and confidentiality and non competition agreements with us however if any dispute arises between any of our management member and us we may have to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to enforce such agreements in china or we may be unable to enforce them at all rapid growth also requires us to hire and retain a wide range of talents who can adapt to a dynamic competitive and challenging business environment and are capable of helping us develop online and offline capabilities we will need to continue to attract and retain experienced and capable personnel at all levels as we expand our business and operations competition for talent table of contents in which we operate is intense and we may need to offer a more attractive compensation and other benefits package including share based compensation to attract and retain them even if were to offer higher compensation and other benefits there is no assurance that these individuals will choose to join or continue to work for us any failure to attract retain or motivate key management and experienced and capable personnel could severely disrupt our business and growth our financial condition and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to seasonality and our quarterly financial results may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future due to seasonality we generally rent out a higher number of apartment units during the graduation season when college students start to look for off campus rental apartments we typically experience a lower level of rental around lunar year end when a large number of migrants return to their hometowns to celebrate the chinese new year it generally picks up after the chinese new year when these migrants return to work as a result of these factors our revenues may vary from quarter to quarter and our quarterly results may not be comparable to the corresponding periods of prior years and you may not be able to predict our annual results of operations based on a quarter to quarter comparison of our results of operations the quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations could result in volatility and cause the price of our adss to fall as our revenues grow these seasonal fluctuations may become more pronounced given our limited operating history and the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results we may be unable to conduct our sales and marketing activities cost effectively we have incurred significant expenses on a variety of sales and marketing efforts designed to expand our resident base and enhance our brand recognition including payroll expenses to our sales team advertising expenses and expenses for organizing marketing campaigns we incurred rmb81 0 million rmb471 0 million us 65 9 million and rmb793 7 million us 111 0 million in sales and marketing expenses in the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 and in the nine months ended september 30 2019 representing 12 3 17 6 and 15 9 respectively of our revenues in the corresponding periods we may not be able to conduct our sales and marketing activities cost effectively and our sales and marketing activities may not be well received and may not result in the levels of brand recognition and resident increases that we anticipate we may also need to explore new sales and marketing methods which may lead to significantly higher sales and marketing expenses and may not yield satisfactory results failure to refine our existing sales and marketing approaches or to introduce new sales and marketing approaches in a cost effective manner could negatively affect our revenues and profitability our failure to protect our intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our revenues and harm our competitive position we rely primarily on a combination of copyright trade secret trademark and anti unfair competition laws and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken or will take in the future to protect our intellectual property will prove to be sufficient for example although we require our employees to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect our proprietary information these agreements might not effectively prevent disclosure of our trade secrets know how or other proprietary information and might not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such confidential information in addition others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties implementation of intellectual property related laws in china has historically been lacking primarily due to ambiguity in the prc laws and enforcement difficulties accordingly intellectual property rights and confidentiality table of contents in china may not be as effective as in the united states or other countries current or potential competitors may use our intellectual property without our authorization in the development of products and services that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours which could reduce demand for our solutions and services adversely affect our revenues and harm our competitive position even if we were to discover evidence of infringement or misappropriation our recourse against such competitors may be limited or could require us to pursue litigation which could involve substantial costs and diversion of management s attention from the operation of our business we may be subject to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims which could be time consuming and costly to defend and if determined adversely against us could materially impact our business we cannot be certain that our services technology system information provided on our online platform do not or will not infringe patents copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims alleging infringement of patents trademarks or copyrights or misappropriation of creative ideas or formats or other infringement of proprietary intellectual property rights the validity enforceability and scope of intellectual property rights protection in internet related industries particularly in china are uncertain and still evolving for example as we face increasing competition and litigation is frequently used to resolve disputes in china we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims and legal proceedings any such proceeding could result in significant costs to us and divert our management s time and attention from the operation of our business as well as potentially adversely impact our reputation even if we are ultimately absolved of all our insurance coverage may not be sufficient which could expose us to significant costs and business we believe we maintain insurance policies in line with industry standards however insurance companies in china currently do not offer as extensive an array of insurance products as are offered by insurance companies in more developed economies as such we may not be able insure certain risks related to our assets or business even if we desire to although we maintain property insurance covering apartment units we operate we do not maintain property insurance covering our equipment and other property that are essential to our business operation business interruption insurance key man life insurance or litigation insurance in addition although we maintain personal injury insurance that covers personal injuries of our renters caused by certain types of accidents in a majority of our apartments such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all types of accidents that may occur or cover all possible losses any uninsured occurrence of business disruption litigation accidents or natural disaster or significant damages to our uninsured equipment or facilities could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations our current insurance coverage may not be sufficient to prevent us from any loss and there is no certainty that we will be able to successfully claim our losses under our current insurance policy on a timely basis or at all if we incur any loss that is not covered by our insurance policies or the compensated amount is significantly less than our actual loss our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected our operations depend on the performance of the internet infrastructure and telecommunications networks in almost all access to the internet in china is maintained through state owned telecommunication operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the ministry of industry and information technology or the miit our it infrastructure is currently deployed and our data is currently maintained through a customized cloud computing system our servers are housed at third party data centers such service provider may have limited access to alternative networks or services in the event of disruptions failures or other problems with china s internet infrastructure or the fixed table of contents telecommunications networks provided by telecommunication service providers with the expansion of our business we may be required to upgrade our technology and infrastructure to keep up with the increasing number and variety of transactions on our platform there can be no assurance that our internet infrastructure and the fixed telecommunications networks in china will be able to support the demands associated with the continued growth in internet usage we our directors and our management may be involved in legal or administrative proceedings or commercial disputes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we our directors and our management may be subject to claims and various legal and administrative proceedings and hence penalties as well that may arise in the ordinary course of business in addition agreements entered into by us sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject us to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party we may be subject to various intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims see 151 we may be subject to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims which could be time consuming and costly to defend and if determined adversely against us could materially impact our business of the merit of particular claims legal and administrative proceedings litigations injunctions and governmental investigations against us our directors and management may be expensive time consuming or disruptive to our operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase our operating expenses addition new legal or administrative proceedings and claims may arise in the future and the current legal or administrative proceedings and claims we face are subject to inherent uncertainties if one or more legal or administrative matters were resolved against us or an indemnified third party for amounts in excess of our management s expectations or certain injunctions are granted to prevent us from using certain technologies in our solutions our business and financial conditions could be materially and adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures injunctive relief or specific performance against us that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results if we fail to remediate our material weakness and implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations meet our reporting obligations or prevent fraud prior to this offering we have been a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified one material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in the standards established by the u s public company accounting oversight board a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis table of contents the material weakness that has been identified relates to insufficient accounting personnel with appropriate u s gaap knowledge for accounting of complex transactions presentation and disclosure of financial statements in accordance with u s gaap and sec reporting requirements the material weakness if not remediated timely may lead to material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements in the future neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm undertook a comprehensive assessment of our internal control for purposes of identifying and reporting material weaknesses and other control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting had we performed a formal assessment of our internal control over financial reporting or had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting additional deficiencies may have been identified the identification of the material weakness and other significant control deficiencies we have taken measures and plan to continue to take measures to remediate these deficiencies see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 151 internal control over financial reporting however the implementation of these measures may not fully address these deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting our failure to correct these deficiencies or our failure to discover and address any other deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely moreover ineffective internal control over financial reporting could significantly hinder our ability to prevent fraud the completion of this offering we will become subject to the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 the sarbanes oxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting commencing with our fiscal year ending december 31 2020 we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our form 20 f filing for that year as required by section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act in addition once we cease to be an emerging growth company as the term is defined in the jobs act our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective moreover even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm after conducting its own independent testing may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented designed operated or reviewed or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us this will require that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts to this offering we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures and we were never required to test our internal controls within a specified period and as a result we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner our management has not completed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial reporting addition our internal controls over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors or fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system s objectives will be met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected table of contents we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act in a timely manner or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements if that were to happen the market price of the adss could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities our failure to fully comply with prc labor related laws may expose us to potential penalties companies operating in china are required to participate in mandatory employee social security schemes that are organized by municipal and provincial governments including pension insurance unemployment insurance childbirth insurance work related injury insurance medical insurance and housing provident funds such schemes have not been implemented consistently by the local governments in china given the different levels of economic development in different locations but generally require us to make contributions to employee social security plans at specified percentages of the salaries bonuses and certain allowances of our employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time in the past we did not make full contributions to social insurance and housing provident funds for some of our employees our failure to make full contributions to social insurance and to comply with applicable prc labor related laws regarding housing funds may subject us to late payment penalties and other fines or labor disputes and we could be required to make up the contributions for these plans which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations to applicable prc laws and regulations employers must open social insurance registration accounts and housing provident fund accounts and pay social insurance and housing provident funds for employees some of our subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities have not opened social insurance registration accounts or housing provident fund accounts and engage third party human resources agencies to pay social insurance and housing provident funds for some of their employees we may be subject to penalties imposed by the local social insurance authorities and the local housing provident fund management centers for failing to discharge our obligations in relation to payment of social insurance and housing provident funds as an employer addition the use of employees of third party labor dispatch agencies who are known in china as dispatched workers is mainly regulated by the interim provisions on labor dispatching which was promulgated by the ministry of human resources and social security in january 2014 it provides that an employer may use dispatched workers only for temporary auxiliary or substitute positions and shall strictly control the number of workers under labor dispatching arrangements the number of dispatched workers used by an employer shall not exceed 10 of the total number of its employees as of the date of this prospectus the number of our dispatched workers as a percentage of our total number of employees exceeds such threshold if the governmental authorities find us to be in violation of the relevant employment regulations we may be subject to penalties and be required to reduce the number of dispatched workers as a result we may incur significant costs to find replacement for dispatched workers and experience disruptions in our operations furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to find suitable employees to replace the dispatched workers if we fail to comply within the time period specified by the labor authority we may be subject to a penalty ranging from rmb5 000 to rmb10 000 per dispatched worker exceeding the 10 threshold we face risks related to catastrophic weather natural disasters potential climate change health epidemics and other outbreaks which could significantly disrupt our operations we are vulnerable to catastrophic weather natural disasters and other calamities some of our apartments are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including earthquakes mudslides fires typhoons tornadoes floods snow ice storms or other severe inclement weather we may also experience power loss or telecommunications failures table of contents events may cause physical damage to our apartments injure our residents and result in negative publicity about us which may in turn cause a decrease in demand for our apartments in these areas additionally the accidental death or injury of our residents due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations furthermore such events may give rise to server interruptions breakdowns system failures or internet failures which could cause the loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or hardware as well as adversely affect our ability to provide our services may experience break ins war riots terrorist attacks or similar events actual or threatened such events and other acts of violence or war could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of the properties under our management could significantly affect our ability to operate those properties and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the chinese economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations business could also be adversely affected by the effects of ebola virus disease h1n1 flu h7n9 flu avian flu severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars or other epidemics our business operations could be disrupted if any of our employees is suspected of having ebola virus disease h1n1 flu h7n9 flu avian flu sars or another contagious disease or condition since it could require our employees to be quarantined and or our offices to be disinfected in addition our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that any of these epidemics harms the chinese economy in general our use of certain leased properties for our warehouses and office could be challenged by third parties or governmental authorities which may cause interruptions to our business operations certain lessors of our leased warehouses and offices in china have not provided us with their property ownership certificates or any other documentation proving their right to lease those properties to us if any of our lessors are not the owners of the properties and they have not obtained consents from the owners or their lessors or permits from the relevant governmental authorities to lease such properties to us our lease arrangements with such lessors could be invalid if any of our leases are invalid we may have to vacate the properties and seek alternative office and warehouse locations or we may have to renegotiate the leases with the owners or other parties who have the right to lease the properties and the terms of the new leases may be less favorable to us this may cause interruptions to our business operations or financial losses although we may seek damages from such lessors such damages may not fully cover the actual losses we suffer our revenue backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues our revenue backlog as of a given date represents total rents service fees and utility charges to be recognized as our revenues under our leases with residents and corporate clients existing as of the date specified assuming all of these leases will be performed to the end of their terms and not renewed however as we our residents or corporate clients may terminate the lease by paying an early termination fee we cannot assure you that all of our existing leases will be performed to the end of their terms any early termination or renegotiation of our existing leases or any default on our existing leases will affect expected revenues reflected in our revenue backlog our revenue backlog is not necessarily indicative of future earnings or revenues and we may not ultimately realize our revenue backlog table of contents we will recognize a substantial amount of share based compensation expense upon the completion of this offering which will have a significant impact on our results of operations pursuant to our 2017 stock inventive plan as amended and restated we may grant options to purchase no more than 274 226 921 of our ordinary shares as of the date of this prospectus we have outstanding options with respect to 176 602 914 ordinary shares that have been granted to our employees and directors under the 2017 stock inventive plan we are required to account for share options granted to our employees directors and consultants in accordance with codification of accounting standards or asc 718 compensation 151 stock compensation we are required to classify share options granted to our employees directors as equity awards and recognize share based compensation expense based on the fair value of such share options with the share based compensation expense recognized over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award because the exercisability of the share options granted by us is conditional upon completion of this offering we have not recognized share based compensation expense relating to these share options granted by us yet a result upon the completion of this offering we expect to begin to recognize a substantial amount of share based compensation expense and we expect the recognition of such share based compensation expenses to have a significant impact on our results of operations in the fiscal quarter in which this offering is completed as of september 30 2019 the total unrecognized compensation costs associated with share options granted to employees amounted to rmb1 276 5 million us 178 6 million moreover if additional share options or other equity incentives are granted to our employees directors or consultants in the future we will incur additional share based compensation expense and our results of operations will be further adversely affected for further information on our equity incentive plans and information on our recognition of related expenses please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 151 critical accounting policies judgments and estimates 151 share based compensation and management 151 equity incentive plans addition we granted in aggregate 281 290 000 restricted shares to the two entities controlled by our co founders respectively pursuant to a restricted share agreement we recognized share based compensation expenses in relation to the restricted shares in an amount of rmb8 6 million rmb5 8million us 812 6 thousand and rmb4 5 million us 631 1 thousand for the years ended december 31 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 respectively risks relating to our corporate structure we rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated vies and their respective shareholders to operate our business which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control and otherwise have a material adverse effect as to our business results of operations and financial we rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated vies and their shareholders to operate our business for a description of these contractual arrangements see our history and corporate structure 151 contractual arrangements with consolidated vies and their shareholders these contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over our consolidated vies if our consolidated vies or their shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements we only have indirect recourse to the assets held by our consolidated vies and we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to enforce such arrangements in reliance on legal remedies under prc law these remedies may not always be effective particularly in light of uncertainties in the prc legal system furthermore in connection with litigation arbitration or other judicial or dispute resolution proceedings involving shareholders of our consolidated vies assets under the name of such share holder including the equity interest in our consolidated vies may be put under court custody as a consequence we cannot table of contents certain that the equity interest in our consolidated vies will be disposed pursuant to our contractual arrangement with their shareholders of these contractual arrangements are governed by prc law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the prc accordingly these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with prc laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with prc legal procedures the legal environment in the prc is not as developed as in other jurisdictions such as the u s as a result uncertainties in the prc legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements in the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements or if we suffer significant time delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements it would be very difficult to exert effective control over our consolidated vies and our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected see 151 risks relating to doing business in china 151 there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of prc laws rules and regulations any failure by our consolidated vies or their respective shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we through one of our subsidiaries and a wholly foreign owned enterprise in the prc have entered into a series of contractual arrangements with our consolidated vies and their shareholders for a description of these contractual arrangements see our history and corporate structure 151 contractual arrangements with consolidated vies and their shareholders if our consolidated vies or their shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements we may incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements we may also have to rely on legal remedies under prc laws including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief and claiming damages which we cannot assure you will be effective under prc laws for example if the shareholders of our consolidated vies were to refuse to transfer their equity interests in the consolidated vies to us or our designee when we exercise the call option pursuant to these contractual arrangements or if they were otherwise to act in bad faith toward us then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations the agreements under our contractual arrangements are governed by prc laws and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in china accordingly these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with prc laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with prc legal procedures the legal system in the prc is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions such as the u s as a result uncertainties in the prc legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements see 151 risks related to doing business in china 151 there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of prc laws rules and regulations meanwhile there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a vie should be interpreted or enforced under prc laws there remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of such arbitration should legal action become necessary in addition under prc laws rulings by arbitrators are final and parties cannot appeal arbitration results in court unless such rulings are revoked or determined unenforceable by a competent court if the losing parties fail to carry out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards in prc courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings which would require additional expenses and delay in the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements or if we suffer significant delay or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements we may not be able to exert effective control over our consolidated vies and relevant rights and licenses held by it which we require in order to operate our business and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected table of contents the shareholders of our consolidated vies may have potential conflicts of interest with us which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the interests of the shareholders of our consolidated vies in their capacities as such shareholders may differ from the interests of our company as a whole as what is in the best interests of our consolidated vies including matters such as whether to distribute dividends or to make other distributions to fund our offshore requirement may not be in the best interests of our company there can be no assurance that when conflicts of interest arise any or all of these individuals will act in the best interests of our company or those conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor in addition these individuals may breach or cause our consolidated vies and their subsidiaries to breach or refuse to renew the existing contractual arrangements with us we do not have arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest the shareholders of our consolidated vies may encounter on one hand and as a beneficial owner of our company on the other hand we however could at all times exercise our call options under the exclusive call option agreements to cause them to transfer all of their equity interest in our consolidated vies to us or a person or persons designated by us as permitted by the then applicable prc laws in addition if such conflicts of interest arise we could also in the capacity of attorney in fact of the then existing shareholders of our consolidated vies as provided under the power of attorney agreements directly appoint new directors of our consolidated vies we rely on the shareholders of our consolidated vies to comply with prc laws and regulations which protect contracts and provide that directors and executive officers owe a duty of loyalty to our company and require them to avoid conflicts of interest and not to take advantage of their positions for personal gains and the laws of the cayman islands which provide that directors have a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to act honestly in good faith with a view to our best interests however the legal frameworks of the prc and the cayman islands do not provide guidance on resolving conflicts in the event of a conflict with another corporate governance regime if we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and the shareholders of our consolidated vies we would have to rely on legal proceedings which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings if the prc government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to our consolidated vies do not comply with prc regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations the prc government regulates telecommunications related businesses through strict business licensing requirements and other government regulations these laws and regulations also include limitations on foreign ownership of prc companies that engage in telecommunications related businesses specifically foreign investors are not allowed to own more than a 50 equity interest in any prc company engaging in value added telecommunications businesses the primary foreign investor must also have experience and a good track record in providing value added telecommunications services or vats overseas we are an exempted company incorporated in the cayman islands we are classified as a foreign enterprise under prc laws and regulations and our wholly foreign owned enterprise in the prc is a foreign invested enterprise or fie accordingly none of these subsidiaries are eligible to operate vats business in china we conduct our vats business in the prc through one of our consolidated vies xiaofangjian one of our prc subsidiaries has entered into a series of contractual arrangements with our consolidated vies and their shareholders which enable us to i exercise effective control over the consolidated vies ii receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the consolidated vies and iii have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interest in the consolidated vies when and to the extent permitted by prc law as a result of these contractual arrangements we have control over and are the primary beneficiary of the consolidated vies and table of contents consolidate their financial results as our consolidated vies under u s gaap for a description of these contractual arrangements see our history and corporate structure 151 contractual arrangements with consolidated vies and their shareholders our corporate structure and contractual arrangements are deemed by the miit or the mofcom or other regulators having competent authority to be illegal either in whole or in part we may lose control of our consolidated vies and have to modify such structure to comply with regulatory requirements however there can be no assurance that we can achieve this without material disruption to our vats business further if our corporate structure and contractual arrangements are found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations including revoking our business and operating licenses levying fines on us confiscating any of our income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations shutting down our services discontinuing or restricting our operations in the prc imposing conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply requiring us to change our corporate structure and contractual arrangements restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds from overseas offering to finance our consolidated vies business and operations and taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business if future prc laws administrative regulations or provisions mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing contractual arrangements we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner or at all failure to take timely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure and business operations our corporate actions are significantly influenced by our co founder director and chief executive officer jing gao who has the ability to exert significant influence over important corporate matters that require approval of shareholders which may deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your adss and materially reduce the value of your investment immediately prior to the completion of this offering our outstanding share capital will be re designated into class a ordinary shares and class b ordinary shares each class a ordinary share is entitled to one vote and each class b ordinary share is entitled to twenty 20 votes at general meetings of our shareholders immediately after the completion of this offering jing gao our co founder director and chief executive officer will beneficially own all of our class b ordinary shares representing 75 7 of the voting power of our total issued and outstanding shares assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional adss as a result of the concentration of ownership jing gao will have considerable influence over corporate matters such as mergers acquisitions consolidations the sale of all or substantially all of our assets reorganization restructuring liquidation and other significant corporate actions this concentration of ownership and the protective provisions in our post offering amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which will become effective upon the completion of this offering may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company which could have the dual effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and reducing the price of the adss in addition in the event that we issue additional class b ordinary shares after completion of this offering it will cause further dilution to the voting power of our class a ordinary shareholders as a result of the foregoing the value of your investment could be materially reduced table of contents our current corporate structure and business operations may be affected by the newly enacted prc foreign investment law on march 15 2019 the national people s congress approved the foreign investment law which became effective on january 1 2020 and replaced three existing laws regulating foreign investment in china namely the wholly foreign invested enterprise law of the prc the sino foreign cooperative joint venture enterprise law of the prc and the sino foreign equity joint venture enterprise law of the prc together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations meanwhile the regulations for the implementation of the foreign investment law came into effect as of january 1 2020 which clarified and elaborated the relevant provisions of the foreign investment law since they are relatively new uncertainties exist in relation to their interpretation the foreign investment law does not explicitly classify whether variable interest entities that are controlled through contractual arrangements would be deemed as foreign invested enterprises if they are ultimately controlled by foreign investors however it has a catch all provision under definition of foreign investment that includes investments made by foreign investors in the prc through other means as provided by laws administrative regulations or the state council therefore it still leaves leeway for future laws administrative regulations or provisions of the state council to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment therefore there can be no assurance that our control over our consolidated vies through contractual arrangements will not be deemed as foreign investment in the future foreign investment law grants national treatment to foreign invested entities except for those foreign invested entities that operate in industries specified as either restricted or prohibited from foreign investment in a negative list that is yet to be published it is unclear whether the negative list to be published will differ from the current special administrative measures for market access of foreign investment negative list if our control over our consolidated vies through contractual arrangements are deemed as foreign investment in the future and any business of our consolidated vies is restricted or prohibited from foreign investment under the negative list effective at the time we may be deemed to be in violation of the foreign investment law the contractual arrangements that allow us to have control over our consolidated vies may be deemed as invalid and illegal and we may be required to unwind such contractual arrangements and or restructure our business operations any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business operation if future laws administrative regulations or provisions mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing contractual arrangements we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner or at all failure to take timely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure and business operations contractual arrangements in relation to our consolidated vies may be subject to scrutiny by the prc tax authorities and they may determine that our consolidated vies owes additional taxes which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition and the value of your investment under applicable prc laws and regulations arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the prc tax authorities the prc enterprise income tax law requires every enterprise in china to submit its annual enterprise income tax return together with a report on transactions with its related parties to the relevant tax authorities the tax authorities may impose reasonable adjustments on taxation if they have identified any related party transactions that are inconsistent with arm s length principles we may face material and adverse tax consequences if the prc tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements among our wholly owned prc subsidiary our consolidated vies and their shareholders were not entered into on an arm s length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable prc laws regulations and rules and adjust their income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment a transfer pricing adjustment could among other things result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by table of contents wholly owned prc subsidiary or consolidated vies for prc tax purposes which could in turn increase their tax liabilities without reducing their tax expenses in addition if our wholly owned prc subsidiary requests the shareholders of our consolidated vies to transfer their equity interests in our consolidated vies at nominal value pursuant to these contractual arrangements such transfer could be viewed as a gift and subject the relevant subsidiary to prc income tax furthermore the prc tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties on our prc subsidiary and consolidated vies for adjusted but unpaid taxes according to applicable regulations our financial position could be materially and adversely affected if the tax liabilities of our prc subsidiary and consolidated vies increase or if they are required to pay late payment fees and other penalties we may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by our consolidated vies that are material to the operation of our business if the entity goes bankrupt or becomes subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding our consolidated vies hold a substantial portion of our assets under the contractual arrangements our consolidated vies may not and their shareholders may not cause it to in any manner sell transfer mortgage or dispose of its assets or its legal or beneficial interests in the business without our prior consent however in the event that the shareholders of our consolidated vies breach these contractual arrangements and voluntarily liquidate our consolidated vies or our consolidated vies declares bankruptcy and all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of third party creditors or are otherwise disposed of without our consent we may be unable to continue some or all of our business activities which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition if our consolidated vies undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding independent third party creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets thereby hindering our ability to operate our business which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition risks relating to doing business in china changes in the political and economic policies of the prc government may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and may result in our inability to sustain our growth and expansion strategies all of our operations are conducted in the prc and all of our revenues are sourced from the prc accordingly our business results of operations and financial condition are affected to a significant extent by economic political and legal developments in the prc prc economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects including the extent of government involvement level of development growth rate control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources although the prc government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises a substantial portion of productive assets in china is still owned by the government in addition the prc government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies the prc government also exercises significant control over china s economic growth by allocating resources controlling payment of foreign currency denominated obligations setting monetary policy regulating financial services and institutions and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies the prc economy has experienced significant growth in the past decades growth has been uneven both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and the rate of growth has been slowing since 2012 any adverse changes in economic conditions in china in the policies of the prc government or in the laws and regulations in china could have a material and adverse effect table of contents overall economic growth of china such developments could adversely affect our business and operating results lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position the prc government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources some of these measures may benefit the overall prc economy but may also have a negative effect on us our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us in addition the prc government has implemented in the past certain measures to control the pace of economic growth these measures may cause decreased economic activity which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our services and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of prc laws rules and regulations all of our operations are conducted in the prc and are governed by prc laws rules and regulations our prc subsidiaries and consolidated vies are subject to laws rules and regulations applicable to foreign investment in china the prc legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes unlike the common law system prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value 1979 the prc government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws rules and regulations governing economic matters in general the overall effect of legislation over the past four decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in china however china has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws rules and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in china or may be subject to significant degrees of interpretation by prc regulatory agencies in particular because these laws rules and regulations are relatively new and because of the limited number of published decisions and the nonbinding nature of such decisions and because the laws rules and regulations often give the relevant regulator significant discretion in how to enforce them the interpretation and enforcement of these laws rules and regulations involve uncertainties and can be inconsistent and unpredictable in addition the prc legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and which may have a retroactive effect as a result we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence of the violation administrative and court proceedings in china may be protracted resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention since prc administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems these uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the approval of the china securities regulatory commission or the csrc may be required in connection with this offering under a prc regulation the regulation also establishes more complex procedures for acquisitions conducted by foreign investors that could make it more difficult for us to grow through on august 8 2006 six prc regulatory agencies including the mofcom the state owned assets supervision and administration commission or the sasac the state administration of taxation the saic the csrc and the state administration of foreign exchange or the safe jointly adopted the regulations on mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors or the m amp a rules which came into effect on september 8 2006 and were amended on june 22 2009 the m amp a rules include among other things provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose table of contents that is controlled by prc domestic companies or individuals and that has been formed for the purpose of an overseas listing of securities through acquisitions of prc domestic companies or assets to obtain the approval of the csrc prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle s securities on an overseas stock exchange on september 21 2006 the csrc published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles however substantial uncertainty remains regarding the scope and applicability of the m amp a rules to offshore special purpose vehicles the application of the m amp a rules remains unclear we believe based on the advice of our prc legal counsel haiwen amp partners that the csrc approval is not required in the context of this offering because i our wholly owned prc subsidiaries were incorporated as foreign invested enterprises by means of foreign direct investments rather than by merger with or acquisition of any prc domestic companies as defined under the m amp a rules and ii there is no statutory provision that clearly classifies the contractual arrangement among our xiaofangjian shanghai information technology co ltd or xiaofangjian and our consolidated vies and their shareholders as transactions regulated by the m amp a rules there can be no assurance that the relevant prc government agencies including the csrc would reach the same conclusion as our prc legal counsel if the csrc or other prc regulatory body subsequently determines that we need to obtain the csrc s approval for this offering or if the csrc or any other prc government authorities promulgates any interpretation or implements rules before our listing that would require us to obtain csrc or other governmental approvals for this offering we may face adverse actions or sanctions by the csrc or other prc regulatory agencies in any such event these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in china limit our operating privileges in china delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from this offering into the prc or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition as well as our ability to complete this offering the csrc or other prc regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us or making it advisable for us to halt this offering before settlement and delivery of the adss offered by this prospectus consequently if you engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to settlement and delivery you do so at the risk that such settlement and delivery may not occur in addition if the csrc or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring us to obtain their approvals for this offering we may be unable to obtain waivers of such approval requirements any uncertainties and or negative publicity regarding such approval requirements could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our adss regulations also established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities in china by foreign investors more time consuming and complex for example the m amp a rules require that the mofcom be notified in advance of any change of control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a prc domestic enterprise if i any important industry is concerned ii such transaction involves factors that have or may have impact on the national economic security or iii such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or prc time honored brand the approval from the mofcom shall be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by prc enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies mergers acquisitions or contractual arrangements that allow one market player to take control of or to exert decisive impact on another market player must also be notified in advance to the mofcom when the threshold under the provisions on thresholds for prior notification of concentrations of undertakings or the prior notification rules issued by the state council in august 2008 is triggered in addition the security review rules issued by the mofcom that became effective in september 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise national defense and security concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise national security concerns are subject to strict review by the mofcom and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review including by structuring the transaction table of contents a proxy or contractual control arrangement we may grow our business in part by acquiring other companies operating in our industry complying with the requirements of the new regulations to complete such transactions could be time consuming and any required approval processes including approval from the mofcom may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share see regulations 151 m amp a rules and overseas listings prc regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by prc residents may subject our prc resident beneficial owners or our prc subsidiaries to liability or penalties limit our ability to inject capital into our prc subsidiaries or limit our prc subsidiaries ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits the safe promulgated the circular on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange control on domestic residents offshore investment and financing and roundtrip investment through special purpose vehicles or safe circular 37 on july 4 2014 which replaced the former circular commonly known as safe circular 75 promulgated by the safe on october 21 2005 safe circular 37 requires prc residents to register with local branches of the safe in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity for the purpose of overseas investment and financing with

in liability under prc laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange have notified all prc residents or entities who directly or indirectly hold shares in our cayman islands holding company and who are known to us as being prc residents or entities to complete the foreign exchange registrations or outbound investment filings nevertheless we may not be aware of the identities of all of our beneficial owners who are prc residents or entities we do not have control over our beneficial owners and there can be no assurance that all of our prc resident or prc entities beneficial owners will comply with safe registration or outbound investment filings requirements and there is no assurance that the registration under safe ndrc or moc regulations will be completed in a timely manner or will be completed at all the failure of our beneficial owners who are prc residents or entities to register or amend their foreign exchange registrations or outbound investment filings in a timely manner or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are prc residents or entities to comply with the registration procedures set forth in safe ndrc or moc regulations may subject such beneficial owners or our prc subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions table of contents to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our prc subsidiaries and limit our prc subsidiaries ability to distribute dividends to our company these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition any failure to comply with prc regulations regarding our employee share incentive plans may subject the prc plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions pursuant to safe circular 37 prc residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non publicly listed companies due to their position as director senior management or employees of the prc subsidiaries of the overseas companies may submit applications to safe or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies our directors executive officers and other employees who are prc residents and who have been granted options may follow safe circular 37 to apply for the foreign exchange registration before our company becomes an overseas listed company after our company becomes an overseas listed company upon completion of this offering we and our directors executive officers and other employees who are prc residents and who have been granted options will be subject to the notice on issues concerning the foreign exchange administration for domestic individuals participating in stock incentive plan of overseas publicly

company who are prc residents are required to register with safe through a domestic qualified agent which could be a prc subsidiary of such overseas listed company and complete certain other procedures we will make efforts to comply with these requirements upon completion of our initial public offering however there can be no assurance that they can successfully register with safe in full compliance with the rules failure to complete the safe registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit the ability to make payment under our share incentive plan or receive dividends or sales proceeds related thereto or our ability to contribute additional capital into our wholly foreign owned enterprise in china and limit our wholly foreign owned enterprise s ability to distribute dividends to us we also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt additional share incentive plan for our directors and employees under prc law state administration of taxation has issued certain circulars concerning employee share options and restricted shares under these circulars our employees working in china who exercise share options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to prc individual income tax our prc subsidiaries have obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options if our employees fail to pay or we fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and regulations we may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other prc governmental authorities we rely to a significant extent on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our principal operating subsidiaries to fund offshore cash and financing requirements any limitation on the ability of our prc operating subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business we are a holding company and rely to a significant extent on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our prc subsidiaries and on remittances from the consolidated vies for our offshore cash and financing requirements including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders fund inter company loans service any debt we may incur outside of china and pay our expenses when our prc subsidiaries or the consolidated vies incur additional debt the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions or remittances to us furthermore the laws rules and regulations applicable to our prc table of contents and certain other subsidiaries permit payments of dividends only out of their retained earnings if any determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards and regulations prc laws rules and regulations each of our subsidiaries and our consolidated vies incorporated in china is required to set aside at least 10 of its net income each year to fund certain statutory reserves until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50 of its registered capital these reserves together with the registered capital are not distributable as cash dividends as a result of these laws rules and regulations our subsidiaries and consolidated vies incorporated in china are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their respective net assets to their shareholders as dividends loans or advances in addition registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from withdrawal in the prc up to the amount of net assets held in each operating subsidiary on the ability of our consolidated vies to make remittance to the wholly foreign owned enterprise and on the ability of our prc subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could limit our ability to access cash generated by the operations of those entities including to make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses pay dividends to our shareholders or otherwise fund and conduct our business we may be treated as a resident enterprise for prc tax purposes under the prc enterprise income tax law and we may therefore be subject to prc income tax on our global income under the prc enterprise income tax law and its implementing rules enterprises established under the laws of jurisdictions outside of china with de facto management bodies located in china may be considered prc tax resident enterprises for tax purposes and may be subject to the prc enterprise income tax at the rate of 25 on their global income de facto management body refers to a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business personnel accounting books and assets of an enterprise the state administration of taxation issued the notice regarding the determination of chinese controlled offshore incorporated enterprises as prc tax resident enterprises on the basis of de facto management bodies or circular 82 on april 22 2009 circular 82 provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the de facto management body of a chinese controlled offshore incorporated enterprise is located in china although circular 82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by prc enterprises not those controlled by foreign enterprises or individuals the determining criteria set forth in circular 82 may reflect the state administration of taxation s general position on how the de facto management body test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises regardless of whether they are controlled by prc enterprises if we were to be considered a prc resident enterprise we would be subject to prc enterprise income tax at the rate of 25 on our global income in such case our profitability and cash flow may be materially reduced as a result of our global income being taxed under the enterprise income tax law we believe that none of our entities outside of china is a prc resident enterprise for prc tax purposes however the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the prc tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term de facto management body dividends payable to our foreign investors and gains on the sale of our adss or ordinary shares by our foreign investors may become subject to prc tax under the enterprise income tax law and its implementation regulations issued by the state council a 10 prc withholding tax is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are non resident enterprises which do not have an establishment or place of business in the prc or which have such establishment or place of business but the dividends are not effectively connected with such establishment or place of business to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the prc similarly any gain realized on the transfer of adss or ordinary shares by such investors is also table of contents to prc tax at a current rate of 10 subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in applicable tax treaties or under applicable tax arrangements between jurisdictions if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the prc if we are deemed a prc resident enterprise dividends paid on our ordinary shares or adss and any gain realized from the transfer of our ordinary shares or adss would be treated as income derived from sources within the prc and would as a result be subject to prc taxation furthermore if we are deemed a prc resident enterprise dividends payable to individual investors who are non prc residents and any gain realized on the transfer of adss or ordinary shares by such investors may be subject to prc tax at a current rate of 20 subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in applicable tax treaties or under applicable tax arrangements between jurisdictions if we or any of our subsidiaries established outside china are considered a prc resident enterprise it is unclear whether holders of our adss or ordinary shares would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between china and other countries or areas if dividends payable to our non prc investors or gains from the transfer of our adss or ordinary shares by such investors are deemed as income derived from sources within the prc and thus are subject to prc tax the value of your investment in our adss or ordinary shares may decline significantly we and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in prc resident enterprises or other assets attributed to a chinese establishment of a non chinese company or immovable properties located in china owned by non chinese companies on february 3 2015 the state administration of taxation issued the bulletin on issues of enterprise income tax on indirect transfers of assets by non prc resident enterprises or bulletin 7 which partially replaced and supplemented previous rules under the notice on strengthening administration of enterprise income tax for share transfers by non prc resident enterprises or sat circular 698 issued by the state administration of taxation on december 10 2009 pursuant to this bulletin 7 an indirect transfer of assets including equity interests in a prc resident enterprise by non prc resident enterprises may be re characterized and treated as a direct transfer of prc taxable assets if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of prc enterprise income tax as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to prc enterprise income tax according to bulletin 7 prc taxable assets include assets attributed to an establishment in china immovable properties located in china and equity investments in prc resident enterprises in respect of which gains from their transfer by a direct holder being a non prc resident enterprise would be subject to prc enterprise income taxes when determining whether there is a reasonable commercial purpose of the transaction arrangement features to be taken into consideration include whether the main value of the equity interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives from prc taxable assets whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consists of direct or indirect investment in china or if its income mainly derives from china whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding prc taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function and risk exposure the duration of existence of the business model and organizational structure the replicability of the transaction by direct transfer of prc taxable assets and the tax situation of such indirect transfer and applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements in respect of an indirect offshore transfer of assets of a prc establishment the resulting gain is to be included with the enterprise income tax filing of the prc establishment or place of business being transferred and would consequently be subject to prc enterprise income tax at a rate of 25 where the underlying transfer relates to the immovable properties located in china or to equity investments in a prc resident enterprise which is not related to a prc establishment or place of business of a non resident enterprise a prc enterprise income tax of 10 would apply subject to available preferential tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements and the party who is obligated to make the transfer payments has the withholding obligation where the payor fails to withhold any or table of contents tax the transferor is required to declare and pay such tax to the tax authority by itself within the statutory time limit late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest bulletin 7 does not apply to income derived by a non resident enterprise from indirect transfer of taxable assets in prc through buying and selling the equity securities of the same listed overseas enterprise on the open market on october 17 2017 the state administration of taxation promulgated the announcement of the state administration of taxation on issues concerning the withholding of non resident enterprise income tax at source sat circular 37 which became effective on december 1 2017 and sat circular 698 then was repealed with effect from december 1 2017 sat circular 37 among other things simplified procedures of withholding and payment of income tax levied on non resident enterprises face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where prc taxable assets are involved such as offshore restructuring sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries or investments our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if our company is transferor in such transactions and may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions under bulletin 7 and sat circular 37 for transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non prc resident enterprises our prc subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under bulletin 7 and sat circular 37 as a result we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with bulletin 7 and sat circular 37 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars or to establish that our company should not be taxed under these circulars which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to restrictions on currency exchange all of our revenues is denominated in renminbi the renminbi is currently convertible under the current account which includes dividends trade and service related foreign exchange transactions but not under the capital account which includes foreign direct investment and loans including loans we may secure from our onshore subsidiaries or consolidated vies currently certain of our prc subsidiaries may purchase foreign currency for settlement of current account transactions including payment of dividends to us without the approval of the safe by complying with certain procedural requirements however the relevant prc governmental authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from or registration with the safe and other relevant prc governmental authorities since a significant amount of our future revenues and cash flow will be denominated in renminbi any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize cash generated in renminbi to fund our business activities outside of the prc or pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders including holders of our adss and may limit our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for our onshore subsidiaries and consolidated vies prc regulation of loans to and direct investment in prc entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent us from using the proceeds of this offering to make loans to our prc subsidiaries and our consolidated vies or to make additional capital contributions to our prc subsidiaries in utilizing the proceeds of this offering we as an offshore holding company are permitted under prc laws and regulations to provide funding to our prc subsidiaries which is treated as a foreign invested enterprise under prc laws through loans or capital contributions however loans by us to our prc subsidiaries to finance its activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterpart of safe and capital contributions to our prc subsidiaries are subject to the requirement of making necessary filings in the foreign investment comprehensive management information system and registration with other governmental authorities in china table of contents promulgated the notice of the state administration of foreign exchange on reforming the administration of foreign exchange settlement of capital of foreign invested enterprises or circular 19 effective on june 1 2015 in replacement of the circular on the relevant operating issues concerning the improvement of the administration of the payment and settlement of foreign currency capital of foreign invested enterprises or safe circular 142 the notice from the state administration of foreign exchange on relevant issues concerning strengthening the administration of foreign exchange businesses or circular 59 and the circular on further clarification and regulation of the issues concerning the administration of certain capital account foreign exchange businesses or circular 45 according to circular 19 the flow and use of the renminbi capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign invested company is regulated such that renminbi capital may not be used for the issuance of renminbi entrusted loans the repayment of inter enterprise loans or the repayment of banks loans that have been transferred to a third party although circular 19 allows renminbi capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign invested enterprise to be used for equity investments within the prc it also reiterates the principle that renminbi converted from the foreign currency denominated capital of a foreign invested company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope thus it is unclear whether safe will permit such capital to be used for equity investments in the prc in actual practice safe promulgated the notice of the state administration of foreign exchange on reforming and standardizing the foreign exchange settlement management policy of capital account or circular 16 effective on june 9 2016 which reiterates some of the rules set forth in circular 19 but changes the prohibition against using renminbi capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign invested company to issue renminbi entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to non associated enterprises violations of safe circular 19 and circular 16 could result in administrative penalties circular 19 and circular 16 may significantly limit our ability to transfer any foreign currency we hold including the net proceeds from this offering to our prc subsidiaries which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in the prc to the restrictions imposed on loans in foreign currencies extended to any prc domestic companies we are not likely to make such loans to our consolidated vies and their subsidiaries each a prc domestic company meanwhile we are not likely to finance the activities of our consolidated vies and their subsidiaries by means of capital contributions given the restrictions on foreign investment in the businesses that are currently conducted by our consolidated vies and their subsidiaries light of the various requirements imposed by prc regulations on loans to and direct investment in prc entities by offshore holding companies we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis if at all with respect to future loans to our prc subsidiaries or any consolidated vies or future capital contributions by us to our prc subsidiaries as a result uncertainties exist as to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our prc subsidiaries or consolidated vies and their subsidiaries when needed if we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals our ability to use foreign currency including the proceeds we received from this offering and to capitalize or otherwise fund our prc operations may be negatively affected which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our if the custodians or authorized user of our controlling non tangible assets including chops and seals fail to fulfill their responsibilities or misappropriate or misuse these assets our business and operations may be materially and adversely affected under prc law legal documents for corporate transactions including agreements and contracts that our business relies on are executed using the chop or seal of the signing entity or with the signature of a legal representative whose designation is registered and filed with the relevant prc industry and commerce authorities table of contents order to maintain the physical security of our chops we generally have them stored in secured locations accessible only to authorized employees although we monitor such authorized employees the procedures may not be sufficient to prevent all instances of abuse or negligence there is a risk that our employees could abuse their authority for example by entering into a contract not approved by us or seeking to gain control of one of our subsidiaries or affiliates if any employee obtains misuses or misappropriates our chops and seals or other controlling intangible assets for whatever reason we could experience disruption to our normal business operations we may have to take corporate or legal action which could involve significant time and resources to resolve and divert management from our operations it may be difficult to effect service of process upon us or our directors or executive officers who reside in china or to enforce against them in china any judgments obtained from non prc courts our directors and executive officers reside within china and most of our assets and the assets of those persons are located within china it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon us or those persons inside china or to enforce against us or them in china any judgments obtained from non prc courts china does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts in the united states the united kingdom japan or most other western countries however judgments rendered by hong kong courts may be recognized and enforced in china if the requirements set forth by the arrangement on mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters by courts of mainland and of the hong kong special administrative region pursuant to agreed jurisdiction by parties concerned are met recognition and enforcement in china of judgments of a court in any of these jurisdictions other than hong kong in relation to any matter not subject to binding arbitration provisions may be difficult or impossible fluctuations in exchange rate could result in foreign currency exchange losses and could materially reduce the value of your investment the value of the renminbi against the u s dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by among other things changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the prc government on july 21 2005 the prc government changed its policy of pegging the value of the renminbi to the u s dollar following the removal of the u s dollar peg the renminbi appreciated more than 20 against the u s dollar over the following three years between july 2008 and june 2010 this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the renminbi and the u s dollar remained within a narrow band since june 2010 the renminbi has fluctuated against the u s dollar at times significantly and unpredictably on november 30 2015 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf completed the regular five year review of the basket of currencies that make up the special drawing right or the sdr and decided that with effect from october 1 2016 renminbi is determined to be a freely usable currency and will be included in the sdr basket as a fifth currency along with the u s dollar the euro the japanese yen and the british pound in the fourth quarter of 2016 the renminbi had depreciated significantly in the backdrop of a surging u s dollar and persistent capital outflows of china this depreciation halted in 2017 and the renminbi appreciated approximately 7 against the u s dollar during this one year period starting from the beginning of 2019 the renminbi has depreciated significantly against the u s dollar again in early august 2019 the pboc set the renminbi s daily reference rate at rmb7 0039 to us 1 00 the first time that the exchange rate of renminbi to u s dollar exceeded 7 0 since 2008 with the development of the foreign exchange market and progress towards interest rate liberalization and renminbi internationalization the prc government may in the future announce further changes to the exchange rate system and we cannot assure you that the renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the u s dollar in the future it is difficult to predict how market forces or prc or u s government policy may impact the exchange rate between the renminbi and the u s dollar in the future table of contents all of our revenues and all of our costs are denominated in renminbi we are a holding company and we rely on dividends paid by our operating subsidiaries in china for our cash needs any significant revaluation of renminbi may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position reported in renminbi when translated into u s dollars and the value of and any dividends payable on the adss in u s dollars to the extent that we need to convert u s dollars we receive from this offering into renminbi for our operations appreciation of the renminbi against the u s dollar would have an adverse effect on the renminbi amount we would receive conversely if we decide to convert our renminbi into u s dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or adss or for other business purposes appreciation of the u s dollar against the renminbi would have a negative effect on the u s the audit report included in this prospectus is prepared by an auditor who is not inspected by the public company accounting oversight board and as such our investors are deprived of the benefits of such inspection our independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included in our prospectus filed with the u s securities and exchange commission as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the united states and a firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board or the pcaob is required by the laws of the united states to undergo regular inspections by the pcaob to assess its compliance with the laws of the united states and professional standards because our auditors are located in china a jurisdiction where the pcaob is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the prc authorities our auditors are not currently inspected by the pcaob on december 7 2018 the sec and the pcaob issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by the u s regulators in their oversight of financial statement audits of u s listed companies with significant operations in china the joint statement reflects a heightened interest in an issue that has vexed u s regulators in recent years however it remains unclear what further actions the sec and pcaob will take to address the problem of other firms that the pcaob has conducted outside of china have identified deficiencies in those firms audit procedures and quality control procedures which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality the lack of pcaob inspections in china prevents the pcaob from regularly evaluating our auditors audits and its quality control procedures as a result investors may be deprived of the benefits of pcaob inspections inability of the pcaob to conduct inspections of auditors in china makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditors audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of china that are subject to pcaob inspections investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements proceedings instituted by the sec against prc affiliates of the big four accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act starting in 2011 the prc affiliates of the big four accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm were affected by a conflict between u s and prc law specifically for certain u s listed companies operating and audited in mainland china the sec and the pcaob sought to obtain from the prc firms access to their audit work papers and related documents the firms were however advised and directed that under prc law they could not respond directly to the u s regulators on those requests and that requests by foreign regulators for access to such papers in china had to be channeled through china securities regulatory commission or the csrc late 2012 this impasse led the sec to commence administrative proceedings under rule 102 e of its rules of practice and also under the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 against the prc accounting table of contents including our independent registered public accounting firm a first instance trial of the proceedings in july 2013 in the sec s internal administrative court resulted in an adverse judgment against the firms the administrative law judge proposed penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice before the sec although that proposed penalty did not take effect pending review by the commissioners of the sec on february 6 2015 before a review by the commissioner had taken place the firms reached a settlement with the sec under the settlement the sec accepted that future requests by the sec for the production of documents will normally be made to the csrc the firms were to receive matching section 106 requests and are required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such requests which in substance require them to facilitate production via the csrc if they failed to meet specified criteria during a period of four years starting from the settlement date the sec retained authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure under the terms of the settlement the underlying proceeding against the four prc based accounting firms was deemed dismissed with prejudice four years after entry of the settlement the four year mark occurred on february 6 2019 it is uncertain whether the sec will further challenge the four prc based accounting firms compliance with u s laws in connection with u s regulatory requests for audit work papers or if the results of such challenge would result in the sec imposing penalties such as suspensions if additional remedial measures are imposed on the chinese affiliates of the big four accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm we could be unable to timely file future financial statements in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act the event the chinese affiliates of the big four become subject to additional legal challenges by the sec or pcaob depending upon the final outcome listed companies in the united states with major prc operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in china which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act including possible delisting moreover any negative news about any such future proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding china based u s listed companies and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected our independent registered public accounting firm was denied even temporarily the ability to practice before the sec and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act such a determination could ultimately lead to the delisting of our adss from the nyse or deregistration from the sec or both which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our adss in the united states risks relating to our adss and this offering there has been no public market for our shares or adss prior to this offering and you may not be able to resell our adss at or above the price you paid or at all prior to this offering there has been no public market for our shares or adss we have been approved for listing our adss representing our class a ordinary shares on the nyse our ordinary shares will not be listed on any exchange or quoted for trading on any over the counter trading system if an active trading market for our adss does not develop after this offering the market price and liquidity of our adss will be materially and adversely affected with the underwriters

market for our adss will develop or that the market price of our adss will not decline below the initial public offering price table of contents participation in this offering by certain of our

offering price representing in aggregate 56 3 of the adss being offered in this offering assuming the underwriters do not exercise their over allotment option such purchase may reduce the available public float and liquidity of our adss relative to what it would have been had these adss been purchased by public investors in addition the strategic investor that indicated interest in purchasing adss in this offering has subscribed for and been allocated by the underwriters 1 850 000 adss in this offering at the initial public offering price representing 19 3 of the adss being offered in this offering assuming the underwriters do not exercise their over allotment option such purchase may further reduce the liquidity of our adss the trading price of our adss may be volatile which could result in substantial losses to you the trading prices of our adss are likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control this may happen because of broad market and industry factors like the performance and fluctuation in the market prices or the underperformance or deteriorating financial results of other listed companies based in china the securities of some of these companies have experienced significant volatility since their initial public offerings including in some cases substantial price declines in the trading prices of their securities the trading performances of other chinese companies securities after their offerings including technology companies and residential rental companies may affect the attitudes of investors toward chinese companies listed in the u s which consequently may impact the trading performance of our adss regardless of our actual operating performance in addition any negative news or perceptions about inadequate corporate governance practices or fraudulent accounting corporate structure or matters of other chinese companies may also negatively affect the attitudes of investors towards chinese companies in general including us regardless of whether we have conducted any inappropriate activities furthermore securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to our operating performance such as the large decline in share prices in the u s china and other jurisdictions in late 2008 early 2009 the second half of 2011 in 2015 and late 2018 which may have a material and adverse effect on the trading price of our adss addition to the above factors the price and trading volume of our adss may be highly volatile due to multiple factors including the actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and changes or revisions of our expected results regulatory developments affecting us or our industry announcements of studies and reports relating to the quality of our product and service offerings or those of our competitors changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other co

representatives to the extent shares are released before the expiration of the applicable lock up period and sold into the market the market price of our adss could decline significantly see shares eligible for future sale 151 lock up agreements major holders of our ordinary shares after completion of this offering will have the right to cause us to register under the securities act the sale of their shares subject to the applicable lock up periods in connection with this offering registration of these shares under the securities act would result in adss representing these shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration sales of these registered shares in the form of adss in the public market could cause the price of our adss to decline significantly if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the market price for our adss and trading volume could decline the trading market for our adss will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if research analysts do not establish and maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our adss or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the market price for our adss would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our adss to decline as our initial public offering price is substantially higher than our net tangible book value per share you will experience immediate and substantial dilution if you purchase adss in this offering you will pay more for your adss than the amount paid by our existing shareholders for their ordinary shares on a per ads basis as a result you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of approximately us 13 25 per ads assuming no exercise of table of contents options to acquire ordinary shares and no exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional adss representing the difference between our pro forma net tangible book value per ads of us 0 25 as of september 30 2019 after giving effect to this offering in addition you will experience further dilution to the extent that our ordinary shares are issued upon the vesting of restrictive shares or exercise of share options under our then equity incentive plans all of the ordinary shares issuable under our then equity incentive plans will be issued at a purchase price on a per ads basis that is less than the public offering price per ads in this offering see dilution for a more complete description of how the value of your investment in our adss will be diluted upon completion of this offering because we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future after this offering you may not receive any return on your investment unless you sell your ordinary shares or adss for a price greater than that which you paid for them we currently intend to retain most if not all of our available funds and any future earnings after this offering to fund the development and growth of our business as a result we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future see dividend policy therefore you should not rely on an investment in our adss as a source for any future dividend income board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends even if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends the timing amount and form of future dividends if any will depend on among other things our future results of operations and cash flow our capital requirements and surplus the amount of distributions if any received by us from our subsidiaries our financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors accordingly the return on your investment in our adss will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our adss there is no guarantee that our adss will appreciate in value after this offering or even maintain the price at which you purchased the adss you may not realize a return on your investment in our adss and you may even lose your entire investment in our adss the voting rights of holders of adss are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement and you may not be able to

the class a ordinary shares represented by your adss indirectly by giving voting instructions to the depositary in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement under the deposit agreement

far as is practicable to vote the underlying class a ordinary shares which are represented by your adss in accordance with your instructions if we do not instruct the depositary to ask for your instructions the depositary may still vote in accordance with instructions you give but it is not required to do so you will not be able to directly exercise your right to vote with respect to the underlying class a ordinary shares represented by your adss unless you withdraw the shares and become the registered holder of such shares prior to the record date for the general meeting under our post offering memorandum and articles of association that will become effective immediately prior to completion of this offering the minimum notice period required to be given by our company to our registered shareholders to convene a general meeting will be ten days when a general meeting is convened you may not receive sufficient advance notice of the meeting to withdraw the class a ordinary shares underlying your adss and become the registered holder of such shares to allow you to attend the general meeting and to table of contents directly with respect to any specific matter or resolution to be considered and voted upon at the general meeting in addition under our post offering memorandum and articles of association that will become effective prior to the completion of this offering for the purposes of determining those shareholders who are entitled to attend and vote at any general meeting our directors may close our register of members and or fix in advance a record date for such meeting and such closure of our register of members or the setting of such a record date may prevent you from withdrawing the class a ordinary shares underlying your adss and becoming the registered holder of such shares prior to the record date so that you would not be able to attend the general meeting or to vote directly if we ask for your instructions the depositary will notify you of the upcoming vote and will arrange to deliver our voting materials to you we have agreed to give the depositary at least 10 days prior notice of shareholder meetings nevertheless we cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote the underlying class a ordinary shares represented by your adss in addition the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for their manner of carrying out your voting instructions this means that you may not be able to exercise your right to direct how the class a ordinary shares underlying your adss are voted and you may have no legal remedy if the class a ordinary shares underlying your adss are not voted as you requested your rights to pursue claims against the depositary as a holder of adss are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement and the deposit agreement may be amended or terminated without your consent under the deposit agreement any action or proceeding against or involving the depositary arising out of or based upon the deposit agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or by virtue of owning the adss which may include claims arising under the u s federal securities laws may only be instituted in a state or federal court in new york new york and you as a holder of our adss will have irrevocably waived any objection which you may have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and irrevocably submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding however there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such forum selection provision no condition stipulation or provision of the deposit agreement or adss serves as a waiver by any holder or beneficial owner of adss or by us or the depositary of compliance with the u s federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder also we may amend or terminate the deposit agreement without your consent if you continue to hold your adss after an amendment to the deposit agreement you agree to be bound by the deposit agreement as amended see description of american depositary shares for more information your right to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited which may cause dilution to your we may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders including rights to acquire our securities however we cannot make rights available to you in the u s unless we register both the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the securities act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available under the deposit agreement the depositary will not make rights available to you unless both the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to ads holders are either registered under the securities act or exempt from registration under the securities act we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective and we may not be able to establish a necessary exemption from registration under the securities act accordingly you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings in the future and may experience dilution in your holdings table of contents you may not receive cash dividends if the depositary decides it is impractical to make them available to you the depositary will pay cash dividends on the adss only to the extent that we decide to distribute dividends on our class a ordinary shares or other deposited securities and we do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future see dividend policy to the extent that there is a distribution the depositary of our adss has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on our class a ordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses you will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your adss represent however the depositary may at its discretion decide that it is inequitable or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of adss for example the depositary may determine that it is not practicable to distribute certain property through the mail or that the value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of mailing them in these cases the depositary may decide not to distribute such property to you we will incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of becoming a public company which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business upon completion of this offering we will become a public company and expect to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and nyse impose various requirements on the corporate governance practices of public companies expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some corporate activities more time consuming and costly in addition once we are no longer an emerging growth company we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and the other rules and regulations of the sec for example as a result of becoming a public company we will need to increase the number of independent directors and adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures we also expect that operating as a public company will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage in addition we will incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements it may also be more difficult for us to find qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules and regulations and we cannot predict or estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs the past shareholders of a public company often brought securities class action suits against the company following periods of instability in the market price of that company s securities if we were involved in a class action suit it could divert a significant amount of our management s attention and other resources from our business and operations which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit any such class action suit whether or not successful could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future in addition if a claim is successfully made against us we may be required to pay significant damages which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition you may be subject to limitations on transfer of your adss your adss are transferable on the books of the depositary however the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties in addition the depositary may refuse to deliver transfer or register transfers of adss generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed or at any time if we or table of contents depositary deems it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or under any provision of the deposit agreement or for any other reason our post offering amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain anti takeover provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us which could limit our shareholders opportunity to sell their shares including ordinary shares represented by our adss at a premium we have adopted the eleventh amended and restated articles of association to be effective upon the completion of this offering that contain provisions to limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change of control transactions these provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction for example our board of directors has the authority without further action by our shareholders to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations powers preferences privileges and relative participating optional or special rights and the qualifications limitations or restrictions including dividend rights conversion rights voting rights terms of redemption and liquidation preferences any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our ordinary shares in the form of ads or otherwise preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult if our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares the price of our adss may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and adss may be materially and adversely affected the dual class structure of our ordinary shares may adversely affect the trading market for our adss certain shareholder advisory firms have announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices including the s amp p 500 to exclude companies with multiple classes of shares and companies whose public shareholders hold no more than 5 of total voting power from being added to such indices in addition several shareholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures as a result the dual class structure of our ordinary shares may prevent the inclusion of our adss representing class a ordinary shares in such indices and may cause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our adss any actions or publications by shareholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our adss certain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable we are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands all of our assets are located outside the u s in addition all of our directors and executive officers and the experts named in this prospectus reside outside the u s and most of their assets are located outside the u s as a result it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against them in the u s in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the u s federal securities laws or otherwise even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind the laws of the cayman islands china or other relevant jurisdiction may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers for more information regarding the relevant laws of the cayman islands and china see enforcement of civil liabilities table of contents ads holders may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to claims arising under the deposit agreement which could result in less favorable outcomes to the plaintiff s in any such action the deposit agreement governing the adss representing our class a ordinary shares provides that to the fullest extent permitted by law ads holders waive the right to a jury trial of any claim they may have against us or the depositary arising out of or relating to our shares the adss or the deposit agreement including any claim under the u s federal securities laws we or the depositary opposed a jury trial demand based on the waiver the court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable based on the facts and circumstances of that case in accordance with the applicable state and federal law to our knowledge the enforceability of a contractual pre dispute jury trial waiver in connection with claims arising under the federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the united states supreme court however we believe that a contractual pre dispute jury trial waiver provision is generally enforceable including under the laws of the state of new york which govern the deposit agreement by a federal or state court in the city of new york which has non exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the deposit agreement in determining whether to enforce a contractual pre dispute jury trial waiver provision courts will generally consider whether a party knowingly intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to a jury trial we believe that this is the case with respect to the deposit agreement and the adss it is advisable that you consult legal counsel regarding the jury waiver provision before entering into the deposit agreement you or any other holders or beneficial owners of adss including purchasers of adss in secondary transactions bring a claim against us or the depositary in connection with matters arising under the deposit agreement or the adss including claims under federal securities laws you or such other holder or beneficial owner may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to such claims which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits against us and the depositary if a lawsuit is brought against either or both of us and the depositary under the deposit agreement it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable trial court which would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would have including results that could be less favorable to the plaintiffs in any such action if this jury trial waiver provision is not permitted by applicable law an action could proceed under the terms of the deposit agreement with a jury trial no condition stipulation or provision of the deposit agreement or adss serves as a waiver by any holder or beneficial owner of adss or by us or the depositary of compliance with the u s federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder you may face difficulties in protecting your interests and your ability to protect your rights through u s courts may be limited because we are incorporated under cayman islands law we are an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands upon the completion of the offering our corporate affairs are governed by our post offering memorandum and articles of association the companies law 2018 revision of the cayman islands and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of shareholders to take action against the directors actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors to us under cayman islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the cayman islands the common law of the cayman islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the cayman islands as well as from the common law of england the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority but are not binding on a court in the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the u s in particular the cayman islands have a less developed body of securities laws than the u s some u s states such as table of contents have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the cayman islands in addition cayman islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the u s of cayman islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies our directors will have discretion under our post offering amended and restated memorandum and articles of association expected to be effective immediately prior to completion of this offering to determine whether or not and under what conditions our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder resolution or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy a result of all of the above our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the u s for a discussion of significant differences between the provisions of the companies law 2018 revision of the cayman islands and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the u s and their shareholders see description of share capital 151

form 6 k however the information we are required to file with or furnish to the sec will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the sec by u s domestic issuers as a result you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a u s domestic issuer we are an emerging growth company and may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including most significantly not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of sarbanes oxley act of 2002 for so long as we are an emerging growth company as a result if we elect not to comply with such auditor attestation requirements our investors may not have access to certain information they may deem important jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until such date that a private company is otherwise required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth table of contents can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period as a result of this election our future financial statements may not be comparable to other public companies that comply with the public company effective dates for these new or revised accounting if we are a passive foreign investment company for united states federal income tax purposes for any taxable year united states holders of our adss or class a ordinary shares could be subject to adverse united states federal income tax consequences a non united states corporation will be a passive foreign investment company or pfic for united states federal income tax purposes for any taxable year if either i at least 75 of its gross income for such year is passive income or ii at least 50 of the value of its assets based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income a separate determination must be made after the close of each taxable year as to whether a non united states corporation is a pfic for that year based on the past and projected composition of our income and assets and the valuation of our assets including goodwill which we have determined based on the expected price of our adss in this offering we do not believe we were a pfic for our most recent taxable year and we do not expect to become a pfic in the current taxable year or in the foreseeable future although there can be no assurance in is possible that we may become a pfic in the current or any future taxable year due to changes in our asset or income composition the composition of our assets and income may be affected by how and how quickly we use our liquid assets and the cash raised in this offering because we have valued our goodwill based on the expected market value of our adss a decrease in the price of our adss may also result in our becoming a pfic addition there is uncertainty as to the treatment of our corporate structure and ownership of our consolidated vies for united states federal income tax purposes for united states federal income tax purposes we consider ourselves to own the equity of our consolidated vies if it is determined contrary to our view that we do not own the equity of our consolidated vies for united states federal income tax purposes for instance because the relevant prc authorities do not respect these arrangements we may be treated as a pfic we are a pfic for any taxable year during which a united states person holds adss or class a ordinary shares certain adverse united states federal income tax consequences could apply to such united states person see taxation 151 certain united states

further dilution to new investors table of contents enforcement of civil liabilities we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands as an exempted company with limited liability we are incorporated in the cayman islands because of certain benefits associated with being a cayman islands company such as political and economic stability an effective judicial system a favorable tax system the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services however the cayman islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and provides protections for investors to a lesser extent in addition cayman islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states all of our operations are conducted in the prc and substantially all of our assets are located in the prc in addition most of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the united states and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon us or these persons or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in united states courts including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states it may also be difficult for you to enforce in united states courts judgments obtained in united states courts based on the civil liability provisions of the united states federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors have appointed cogency global inc as our agent to receive service of process with respect to any action brought against us in the united states district court for the southern district of new york under the federal securities laws of the united states or of any state in the united states or any action brought against us in the supreme court of the state of new york in the county of new york under the securities laws of the state of new york and calder hong kong llp our counsel as to cayman islands law and haiwen amp partners our counsel as to prc law have advised us that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands or the prc would respectively 1 recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states and 2 entertain original actions brought in the cayman islands or the prc against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states and calder hong kong llp has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment obtained in the federal or state courts of the united states will be recognised and enforced in the courts of the cayman islands at common law without any re examination of the merits of the underlying dispute by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the grand court of the cayman islands provided such judgment a is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction b imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given c is not in respect of taxes fines penalties or similar charges and d is neither obtained in a manner nor is of a kind the enforcement of which is against natural justice or the public policy of the cayman islands however the cayman islands courts are unlikely to enforce a punitive judgment of a united states court predicated upon the liabilities provision of the federal securities laws in the united states without retrial on the merits if such judgment gives rise to obligations to make payments that may be regarded as fines penalties or similar charges partners has advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the prc civil procedure law prc courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the prc civil procedure law based either on treaties between china and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions china does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the united states or the cayman islands that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign table of contents in addition according to the prc civil procedures law courts in the prc will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of prc law or national sovereignty security or public interest as a result it is uncertain whether and on what basis a prc court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the united states or in the cayman islands under the prc civil procedures law foreign shareholders may originate actions based on prc law against a company in china for disputes if they can establish sufficient nexus to the prc for a prc court to have jurisdiction and meet other procedural requirements including among others the plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case and there must be a concrete claim a factual basis and a cause for the suit however it would be difficult for foreign shareholders to establish sufficient nexus to the prc by virtue only of holding our adss or class a ordinary shares table of contents our history

buildings or floors in a building transform them into dormitory style apartments and provide to corporate clients for employee accommodation for all of our residents we provide high quality one stop services including cleaning repair and maintenance wifi as well as 24 7 resident support currently generate revenues primarily from rents and service fees our revenues increased by 307 3 from rmb656 8 million in 2017 to rmb2 675 0 million us 374 3 million in 2018 and by 198 8 from rmb1 673 0 million in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to rmb4 999 7 million us 699 5 million in the nine months ended september 30 2019 key factors affecting our results of operations our results of operations are affected by the general factors affecting china s residential rental market including among others china s overall economic growth and urbanization rate level of housing prices and rental prices growth of population with rental needs consumption upgrade driving demand for better services increasing usage of internet for browsing and transactions and emergence of co living platforms it is also affected by changes in regulatory environment such as adoption of table of contents policies supporting the growth of residential rental market while our business is influenced by general factors affecting our industry our results of operations are more directly affected by company specific factors including the following major factors number of our apartment units our ability to continuously expand our co living platform and source a large number of apartment units is the basis of our rapid business expansion and revenues growth we plan to increase such number by exploring new neighborhoods in our existing cities and expanding into new cities that are economically vibrant and have a large population with rental needs whether we can succeed in continually increasing the number of our apartment units depends on the accuracy of our city level and neighborhood level planning as well as the competitive landscape in the geographic areas we target it also depends to a large extent on our efficiency in sourcing apartments including the size and resources of our business development team and the effectiveness of our technology system in aiding our geographic expansion through analytics of multi dimensional rental related data addition we typically enter into four to six year leases with property owners of danke apartment and ten year leases with property owners of dream apartment our ability to secure high quality apartments on a long term basis at locked in cost helps us achieve promising return over the entire lifecycle level of rents and service fees we charge we currently generate substantially all of our revenues from rents and service fees and plan to offer additional value added services such as iot smart home moving services financial and insurance services new retail and other local services which would increase our service fees the level of rents and service fees we are able to charge depends on the market rates in the geographic areas we operate and the intensity of competition in such areas we operate in a mix of cities in china and some cities in particular beijing shanghai and shenzhen generally have higher market rents than the other cities we utilize an intelligent pricing system to set pricing for our apartment units through algorithms and big data analytics the effectiveness of such system impacts our ability to optimize pricing ability to manage occupancy rate our results of operations are affected by our ability to manage the occupancy rate of our apartment units after we source an apartment from the property owner we need to renovate and furnish the apartment and seek residents to fill the apartment which will adversely affect our occupancy rate during such period as such when we rapidly expand our co living platform and acquire a large number of apartment units our occupancy rate for the relevant period may be adversely affected endeavor to continuously improve the quality of our apartment units and services and upgrade and diversify our product and service offerings to appeal to more potential residents which we believe help shorten the vacancy period of our apartment units the efficiency of our sales team and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts including general brand advertising and targeted marketing campaigns to improve our brand awareness also play an important role as we improve the efficiency of our sales team and enhance our sales and marketing efforts we will be able to shorten the vacancy period of our apartment units and improve our occupancy rate the effectiveness of our artificial intelligence technology in making personalized recommendations also helps improve our occupancy rate table of contents ability to effectively manage our operating expenses our ability to effectively manage our operating expenses while continuing to grow our business is essential to our results of operations rental cost collectively with pre opening expense represent the rents we pay to the property owners which constitute the largest component of our operating expenses in particular pre opening expense is incurred during a period in which no revenue is generated and thus our ability to improve our efficiency in renovation and furnishing and reduce the average length of the pre opening period is an important factor affecting our results of operations the pre opening period approximates the time required for renovation and furnishing the average time for renovation and furnishing was 22 4 days 21 1 days and 18 7 days in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 respectively increased business scale and enhanced brand influence will improve our bargaining power with property owners and enable us to more effectively control our rental cost in addition the long term nature of our leases with property owners enables us to lock in rental cost with relatively low rent escalation at an early stage depreciation and amortization is another major component of our operating expenses which corresponds with our renovation and furnishing cost our ability to control renovation and furnishing cost depends largely on our supply chain efficiency and bargaining power with our suppliers to obtain more favorable pricing terms which can be achieved through economies of scale moreover our ability to effectively manage our sales and marketing expenses also affect our results of operations as our business further grows we believe we will be able to take advantage of increased economies of scale to further improve our operational efficiency over time key operating metrics we regularly review a number of key operating metrics to evaluate our business and measure our performance which are set forth in the table as of december 31 as of september 30 number of cities in which we operated number of apartment units we operated pre opening apartment units 1 opened apartment units 2 number of apartment units we operated beijing shanghai and shenzhen apartment units that are within the pre opening period table of contents apartment units that achieve ready to move in status including those rented out and to be rented out average revenues per rented out unit per month 1 average leasing cost per unit per month 2 the revenues recognized in the period presented divided by rented out unit days i e the simple sum of the number of days we rented out each apartment unit during a particular period in such period

days i e the simple sum of the number of days we operated each apartment unit during a particular period in such period multiplied by the average number of days per month assuming 30 days per month operate in a mix of cities in china and some cities in particular beijing shanghai and shenzhen generally have higher market rents than the other cities therefore as we expand into more cities the average revenues per rented out unit per month and the average leasing cost per unit per month may fluctuate over time on the other hand the average rental spread defined as the average revenues per rented out unit per month less the average leasing cost per unit per month as a percentage of the average revenues per rented out unit per month in the other cities is in general higher than in beijing shanghai and shenzhen in the nine months ended september 30 2019 we strategically accelerated our expansion and offered rental discounts to our residents which contributed to the decrease of the average rental spread as a percentage of the average revenues per rented out unit per month from the same period in 2018 occupancy rate 1 the number of rented out apartment units as a percentage

revenue backlog from 2017 to 2018 and further to the nine months ended september 30 2019 was primarily driven by the rapid expansion of our apartment network we aim to operate our business so that each new apartment unit is accretive to our long term financial performance after we sign new leases with the property owners we need to invest in renovating and furnishing the newly sourced apartment units which generally takes 17 21 days before they are ready for renting to our residents before an apartment unit is filled we incur leasing cost to the property owner in addition to initial investment without generating revenues table of contents we fill our ready to move in apartment units leveraging our sales and marketing efforts after we rent out a unit we start collecting rents and service fees from our resident generating a recurring stream of revenues and cash flows at this point the net cash flows shift from outgoing to incoming as we generate revenues over each period after the apartment unit is filled the cumulative incoming cashflow will allow us to recover our initial investment after a certain period of time and start realizing returns from such apartment unit we refer to the amount of time required to recover the initial capital investment for the apartment units sourced in a given period as payback period it is calculated as the average cost for renovation and furnishing per unit for such period divided by the average rental spread for such period from the first quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2019 the payback period for the apartment units sourced in each quarter typically ranged between 12 to 20 months as we expand our scale we will be able to improve our cost efficiency further enhance our return and shorten our payback typically sign leases for four to six years with property owners to lock in favorable terms and asset exclusivity and one year leases with our residents we are therefore able to lock in stable leasing cost over the terms of the leases with property owners and enjoy potential upside from rent increase on the resident side in addition as we introduce more value added services to our residents we will continue to increase the overall lifetime value of each of our apartment unit intend to continue to deploy capital to grow and source new apartment units since we are currently in a rapid growth stage we expect to continue to incur upfront investment for our newly sourced apartment units as a higher percentage of our apartment units pass their pay back period over time we believe that our profitability profile will continue to improve key components of results of operations we derive our revenues primarily from rents we charge for renting our apartment units to our residents and service fees for providing various services to our residents including cleaning repair and maintenance wifi and 24 7 resident support we have been enriching our value added services and began charging a monthly service fee in late 2017 which was typically 6 to 8 of the monthly rent we also derive revenues from other sources such as early termination fees and utilities such as water and gas our revenues are

expenses technology and product development expenses mainly consist of payroll and related expenses engaged in developing and improving rental products technology system and it infrastructure as well as expenses associated with the use of facilities and equipment for research and development such as depreciation expenses interest expenses interest expenses primarily consist of the interest expenses related to rent financing we cooperate with licensed financial institutions to offer rent financing to certain of our residents the typical amount financed under such arrangement is rent for 11 months which covers the entire lease term excluding the first month the resident makes an upfront deposit with us and pays us the first month of rent and service fee the financial institution makes an upfront payment equal to the rent for the rest of the resident s lease term to us and we pay the corresponding interest to the relevant financial institution we consider such arrangement as financing activities and record such interest as our interest expenses we do not directly provide any special incentives to the residents to cause them to enter into such arrangement we believe many of our residents choose to enter into the rent financing arrangement because it allows the residents to make advance payment for their rent on a monthly basis in the form of loan repayment to the financial institutions as opposed to quarterly semi annual or annual advance payment if they do not opt for such arrangement 91 3 75 8 and 67 9 of the residents who had valid leases with us in 2017

interest expense interest income investment income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense are subject to seasonality in our business we typically experience a lower level of rental around lunar year end when a large number of migrants return to their hometowns to celebrate the chinese new year resulting in slower quarter over quarter growth in revenues in the first quarter we generally rent out a higher number of apartment units during the graduation season when college students start to look for off campus rental apartments leading to higher quarter over quarter growth in revenues in the second and third quarter given the rapid growth of our business during the periods presented the quarterly results of operations may not fully reflect the impact of seasonality our operating expenses continued to increase over the past eleven quarters as we grew our business and expanded our apartment network the pre opening expense in the second quarter of 2019 was lower than the first quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2018 primarily because we strategically sourced a substantial number of apartments in the fourth quarter of 2018 in preparation for the first half of 2019 resulting in a lower number of pre opening apartment units in the second quarter of 2019 as table of contents an increasing number of apartments in the third quarter of 2019 the pre opening expenses

interest expenses liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been upfront payment from financial institutions in connection with rent financing advance from our residents issuance of equity securities and bank loans to our onshore entities guaranteed by our offshore entities which have historically been sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements of december 31 2018 and september 30 2019 we had cash of rmb1 087 3 million us 152 1 million and rmb376 5 million us 52 7 million respectively and restricted cash of rmb1 378 3 million us 192 8 million and rmb1 921 3 million us 268 8 million respectively our restricted cash represented cash deposited with the banks in connection with borrowings from the banks and with financial institutions that offer rent financing expansion of our apartment network involves significant capital outlay including capital required for sourcing renovating and furnishing our apartment units and paying deposits and rents to property owners due to our rapid expansion we had net cash used in operating activities of rmb114 6 million rmb1 164 2 million us 162 9 million and rmb1 629 3 million us 227 9 million in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 respectively while advance rent payments from our residents is an important source of our operating cash inflow we also cooperated with financial institutions that provide rent financing to our residents and make upfront payments to us such arrangements while financing activities in substance and recorded as cash inflow from financing activities constitute an important source of cash inflow to support our business operation as of september 30 2019 we had upfront payment from table of contents institutions in connection with rent financing of rmb3 105 7 million us 434 5 million and advance from our residents of rmb794 3 million us 111 1 million 91 3 75 8 and 67 9 of the residents who had valid leases with us in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 had rent financing arrangements with us in the respective periods indicated the substantial decrease in such percentage was primarily due to our strategy to enhance our cooperation with more reputable financial institutions that offer lower interest rate and have more stringent credit assessment procedures in addition the opinion on rectifying and regulating the order of the residential rental market which became effective on december 13 2019 requires that a residential rental company such as us to make sure that the amount of payment it receives through rent financing does not exceed 30 of the rental income of such company by the end of 2022 see regulation 151 regulations on real estate leasing services 151 general regulations on housing leasing as such we plan to further reduce such ratio to below 30 by the end of 2021 we do not expect that the downward trend in utilization of rent financing will have a material adverse effect on our prospective liquidity since we can receive advance payment of rents and deposits from an increasing number of residents who do not utilize rent financing and we have diversified funding sources including bank borrowings and are exploring new types of financing such as supply chain financing to maintain our liquidity if our residents early terminate their leases with us we may be required to return applicable upfront payments to relevant financial institution or return applicable advance rent payment to the residents in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 the total amount of upfront payment that we returned to financial institutions in the event of early termination of the leases or defaults by the residents on loan repayment was rmb436 6 million rmb1 757 1 million us 245 8 million and rmb1 759 4 million us 246 1 million respectively however we expect to be able to rent out the vacated apartment units to new residents within a relatively short period of time and collect advance rent payments from the new residents or receive new upfront payments from financial institutions if the new residents decide to use rent financing solution as such we do not believe we have significant liquidity risk due to our net current liabilities believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operating activities and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business for the next 12 months we may however need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changes in business conditions or other developments or if we find and wish to pursue opportunities for investments acquisitions capital expenditures or similar actions if we determine that our cash requirements exceed the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have on hand at the time or decide to enhance our liquidity position or increase our cash reserve for expansion of our apartment network or other operational needs we may seek to issue equity or debt securities or enter into additional credit facilities the issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations while we are exploring new types of financing such as supply chain financing we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure such financing or reach an agreement on financing terms with banks or other relevant parties that are acceptable to us due to reasons beyond our control we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all see risk factors 151 risks relating to our business and industry 151 our business requires significant capital to expand our apartment network and renovate and furnish our apartments inability to obtain capital through financing or other sources on favorable terms in a timely manner or at all would materially and adversely affect our business results of operations

risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us holding company structure we are a holding company with no material operations of our own we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries consolidated vies and our subsidiaries in china as a result our ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our prc subsidiaries if our existing prc subsidiaries or any newly formed ones incur debt on their behalf in the future the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us in addition our wholly foreign owned subsidiary in china is permitted to pay dividends to us only out of its retained earnings if any as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations under prc law each of our subsidiaries our consolidated vie and its subsidiaries in china are required to set aside at least 10 of its after tax profits each year if any to fund certain statutory reserve funds until such reserve funds reach 50 of its registered capital in addition our wholly foreign owned subsidiary in china may allocate a portion of its after tax profits based on prc accounting standards to enterprise expansion funds and staff bonus and welfare funds at its discretion and our consolidated vie and its subsidiaries may allocate a portion of its after tax profits based on prc accounting standards to a discretionary surplus fund at their discretion the statutory reserve funds and the discretionary funds are not distributable as cash dividends remittance of dividends by a

bureau of statistics of china the year over year percent changes in the consumer price index for december 2017 and 2018 were increases of 1 8 and 1 9 respectively although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past we may be affected if china experiences higher rates of inflation in the future quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in renminbi the functional currency of our subsidiaries in the prc the consolidated vies and their subsidiaries is the renminbi we use renminbi as our reporting currency monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date transactions in currencies other than the functional currency during the year are converted into functional currency at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occurred transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk although in table of contents to foreign exchange risks should be limited the value of your investment in our adss will be affected by the exchange rate between the u s dollar and the renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi while our adss will be traded in u s dollars conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies including u s dollars is based on rates set by the pboc the prc government allowed the renminbi to appreciate by more than 20 against the u s dollar between july 2005 and july 2008 between july 2008 and june 2010 the exchange rate between the renminbi and the u s dollar had been stable and traded within a narrow band since june 2010 the renminbi has fluctuated against the u s dollar at times significantly and unpredictably on november 30 2015 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf completed the regular five year review of the basket of currencies that make up the special drawing right or the sdr and decided that with effect from october 1 2016 renminbi is determined to be a freely usable currency and will be included in the sdr basket as a fifth currency along with the u s dollar the euro the japanese yen and the british pound in the fourth quarter of 2016 the renminbi has depreciated significantly in the backdrop of a surging u s dollar and persistent capital outflows of china this depreciation halted in 2017 and the renminbi appreciated approximately 7 against the u s dollar during this one year period starting from the beginning of 2019 the renminbi has depreciated significantly against the u s dollar again in early august 2019 the pboc set the renminbi s daily reference rate at rmb7 0039 to us 1 00 the first time that the exchange rate of renminbi to u s dollar exceeded 7 0 since 2008 with the development of the foreign exchange market and progress towards interest rate liberalization and renminbi internationalization the prc government may in the future announce further changes to the exchange rate system and we cannot assure you that the renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the u s dollar in the future it is difficult to predict how market forces or prc or u s government policy may impact the exchange rate between the renminbi and the u s dollar in the future the extent that we need to convert u s dollars into renminbi for our operations appreciation of the renminbi against the u s dollar would have an adverse effect on the renminbi amount we receive from the conversion conversely if we decide to convert renminbi into u s dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or adss or for other business purposes appreciation of the u s dollar against the renminbi would have a negative effect on the u s dollar amounts available to us estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately us 116 5 million from this offering if the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional adss after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us assuming that we convert the full amount of the net proceeds from this offering into renminbi a 10 appreciation of the u s dollar against the renminbi from the exchange rate of rmb7 1477 for us 1 00 as of september 30 2019 to a rate of rmb7 8625 to us 1 00 will result in an increase of rmb83 2 million in our net proceeds from this offering conversely a 10 depreciation of the u s dollar against the renminbi from the exchange rate of rmb7 1477 for us 1 00 as of september 30 2019 to a rate of rmb6 4329 to us 1 00 will result in a decrease of rmb83 2 million in our net proceeds from this offering interest rate risk we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates and we have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest risk exposure however we cannot provide assurance that we will not be exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rate in the future the completion of this offering we may invest the net proceeds we receive from the offering in interest earning instruments investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value table of contents impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall critical accounting policies judgments and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with u s gaap which requires us to make judgments estimates and assumptions we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant accounting estimates the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this

particularly in tier 1 and tier 2 cities most cities in china especially tier 1 and have seen substantial increases in property prices over the past 20 years purchasing a property has thus become increasingly unaffordable the price for a 100 square meter home ranged from 25 to 36 times of the average annual household income in beijing shanghai and shenzhen during the first half of 2019 among

residential rental market a priority in order to address housing problems in large cities a number of supportive policies have been adopted including granting renters equal access to public schools and other public services and creating new financing channels for property rental companies trend in residential rents average residential rents in china have increased at a moderate rate in recent years going forward rents are expected to increase at an accelerated rate for the next five years especially in tier 1 and tier 2 cities average monthly residential rents index in china re based to 2016 china overall source iresearch the current state of china s residential rental market while there is strong and growing demand for rental housing the conventional residential rental market in

scale and converting them into standardized and refurbished units while offering an efficient transaction process and post rental services through this co living platforms address the pain points of both renters and property owners is the biggest issue for young renters today particularly in tier 1 and tier 2 cities in the conventional residential rental market the smallest unit available for rent is often an entire apartment as individual property owners are generally unable or otherwise unwilling to bear the burden and risk of renting out private rooms co living platforms reduce the smallest unit available for rent to a private room which we term apartment unit thereby providing an affordable alternative below is an illustration of the difference in average cost of renting a studio or one bedroom apartment compared with renting a private room with shared common space from danke in the same neighborhood in beijing in the nine months ended september 30 table of contents

average monthly rent for danke s private room with shared common space such as living room kitchen and bathroom in the six urban districts of beijing mentioned above source iresearch key trends supporting the opportunity for co living platforms a number of secular trends are driving the rise in popularity of co living platforms and their deepening penetration of the residential rental sharing economy the current young generation is demonstrating a greater openness to the idea of sharing renting private rooms instead of an entire apartment has become an increasingly popular choice among young people in large cities online consumption the current young generation is accustomed to shopping ride hailing and food delivery all being a tap away an increasing number of renters are comfortable renting an apartment online without offline viewings from co living platforms with a reputation for consistent quality consumption upgrade the current young generation increasingly desires convenience reliability and quality of products and services this overall trend suggests that young people in china will increasingly favor the quality and standardized offerings of co living platforms over the inconsistent quality of apartments offered by individual property owners increasing acceptance by property owners as the offerings of co living platforms in china become better known property owners recognize the proposition they offer this has seen an increasing willingness of property owners to rent to co living platforms rather than manage the properties themselves and rent to individual table of contents most of the residential rental properties in china are still owned and operated by individual property owners properties operated by co living platforms offering standardized renovation furnishing and services only accounted for roughly 2 of all residential rental properties in china as of the end of 2018 in the united states and japan the percentage of renovated or serviced rental apartments operated by institutions was around 57 and 80 respectively we believe this suggests an enormous growth potential for co living platforms in china the value added services opportunity for co living platforms as co living platforms achieve scale they accumulate a large captive pool of renters to whom value added services can be provided typical renters spend more than ten hours each day at home and during their stay they may demand a wide range of services including cleaning repair and maintenance laundry relocation food delivery smart home and online insurance among others these services represented a nearly rmb2 4 trillion market in china in 2018 according to iresearch this represents an enormous incremental opportunity beyond that offered by the residential rental market our addressable market we see china s overall residential rental market as our total addressable market and the residential rental market in tier 1 and tier 2 cities

company we are an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the companies law the companies law in the cayman islands distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies any company that is registered in the cayman islands but conducts business mainly outside of the cayman islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company the requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary company except that an exempted company does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the registrar of companies is not

nyse hold an annual general meeting of shareholders in addition our post offering amended and restated articles of association provides that a general meetings of shareholders may be convened by a majority of our directors table of contents differences in corporate law the companies law is derived to a large extent from the older companies acts of england but does not follow recent united kingdom statutory enactments and accordingly there are significant differences between the companies law and the current companies act of england in addition the companies law differs from laws applicable to united states corporations and their shareholders set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the companies law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the state of delaware mergers and similar arrangements the companies law permits mergers and consolidations between cayman islands companies and between cayman islands companies and non cayman islands companies for these purposes i merger means the merging of two or more constituent companies and the vesting of their undertaking property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving company and ii a consolidation means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a consolidated company and the vesting of the undertaking property and liabilities of such companies to the consolidated company in order to effect such a merger or consolidation the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation which must then be authorized by a a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company and b such other authorization if any as may be specified in such constituent company s articles of association the written plan of merger or consolidation must be filed with the registrar of companies of the cayman islands together with a declaration as to the solvency of the consolidated or surviving company a list of the assets and liabilities of each constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members and creditors of each constituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the cayman islands gazette court approval is not required for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures merger between a cayman parent company and its cayman subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution of shareholders of that cayman subsidiary if a copy of the plan of merger is given to every member of that cayman subsidiary to be merged unless that member agrees otherwise for this purpose a company is a parent of a subsidiary if it holds issued shares that together represent at least ninety percent 90 of the votes at a general meeting of the subsidiary consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest over a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived by a court in the cayman islands in certain circumstances a dissentient shareholder of a cayman constituent company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting to a merger or consolidation the exercise of appraisal rights will preclude the exercise of any other rights save for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation is void or unlawful addition there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent three fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors as the case may be that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting or meetings convened for that purpose the convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the grand court of the cayman islands while a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met table of contents the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest and the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the companies law companies law also contains a statutory power of compulsory acquisition which may facilitate the squeeze out of dissentient minority shareholder upon a tender offer when a tender offer is made and accepted by holders of 90 of the shares within four months the offeror may within a two month period commencing on the expiration of such four month period require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer an objection can be made to the grand court of the cayman islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud bad faith or collusion an arrangement and reconstruction by way of scheme of arrangement is thus approved and sanctioned or if a tender offer is made and accepted in accordance with the foregoing statutory precedures the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of delaware corporations providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares shareholders suits in principle we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder however based on english authorities which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the cayman islands there are exceptions to the foregoing principle including a company acts or proposes to act illegally or ultra vires the act complained of although not ultra vires could only be effected if duly authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not been obtained and those who control the company are perpetrating a fraud on the minority indemnification of directors and executive officers and limitation of liability cayman islands law does not limit the extent to which a company s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors except to the extent any such provision may be held by the cayman islands courts to be contrary to public policy such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime our post offering memorandum and articles of association provides that that we shall indemnify our officers and directors against all actions proceedings costs charges expenses losses damages or liabilities incurred or sustained by such directors or officer other than by reason of such person s dishonesty willful default or fraud in or about the conduct of our company s business or affairs including as a result of any mistake of judgment or in the execution or discharge of his duties powers authorities or discretions including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing any costs expenses losses or liabilities incurred by such director or officer in defending whether successfully or otherwise any civil proceedings concerning our company or its affairs in any court whether in the cayman islands or elsewhere this standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the delaware general corporation law for a delaware corporation in addition we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and senior executive officers that will provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association table of contents insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to our directors officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions we have been informed that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable anti takeover provisions in the post offering memorandum and articles of association some provisions of our post offering amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or management that shareholders may consider favorable including provisions that authorize our board of directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to designate the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such preferred shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders and limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general meetings of shareholders under cayman islands law our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our post offering amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as amended and restated from time to time for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our company directors fiduciary duties under delaware corporate law a director of a delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders this duty has two components the duty of care and the duty of loyalty the duty of care requires that a director act in good faith with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances under this duty a director must inform himself of and disclose to shareholders all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction the duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation he or she must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage this duty prohibits self dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally in general actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation however this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation a matter of cayman islands law a director of a cayman islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he or she owes the following duties to the company 151 a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company a duty not to make a profit based on his or her position as director unless the company permits him to do so a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party and a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which such powers were intended a director of a cayman islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care it was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience however english and commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the cayman islands table of contents shareholder action by written consent under the delaware general corporation law a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation cayman islands law and our post offering amended and restated articles of association provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of each shareholder who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held shareholder proposals under the delaware general corporation law a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents a special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings companies law provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting and does not provide shareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting however these rights may be provided in a company s articles of association our post offering memorandum and articles of association allow any one or more of our shareholders who together hold shares which carry in aggregate not less than one third of the total number of votes attaching to all issued and outstanding shares of our company entitled to vote at general meetings to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders in which case our board is obliged to convene an extraordinary general meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting other than this right to requisition a shareholders meeting our post offering memorandum and articles of association do not provide our shareholders with any other right to put proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings as an exempted cayman islands company we are not obliged by law to call shareholders annual general meetings cumulative voting under the delaware general corporation law cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director which increases the shareholder s voting power with respect to electing such director as permitted under cayman islands law our post offering amended and restated articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting as a result our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a delaware corporation removal of directors under the delaware general corporation law a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise under our amended and restated articles of association directors may be removed by ordinary resolution or subject to the post offering amended and restated articles of association by the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the directors present and voting at a board transactions with interested shareholders the delaware general corporation law contains a business combination statute applicable to delaware corporations whereby unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by table of contents statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an interested shareholder for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder an interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15 or more of the target s outstanding voting stock within the past three years this has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally the statute does not apply if among other things prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder this encourages any potential acquirer of a delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target s board of directors islands law has no comparable statute as a result we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the delaware business combination statute however although cayman islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and for a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders dissolution winding up under the delaware general corporation law unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100 of the total voting power of the corporation only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation s outstanding shares delaware law allows a delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board under cayman islands law a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the cayman islands or by a special resolution of its members or if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due by an ordinary resolution of its members the court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is in the opinion of the court just and equitable to do so cayman islands law a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the cayman islands or by a special resolution of its members or if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due by

2018 revision of the cayman islands we have obtained an undertaking from the financial secretary of the cayman no law which is enacted in the cayman islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits income gains or appreciation shall apply to us or our operations and no tax to be levied on profits income gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable or in respect of the shares debentures or other obligations of the company or way of withholding in whole or in part of any relevant payment as defined in section 6 3 of the tax concessions law 2018 revision undertaking for us is for a period of twenty years from september 23 2019 people s republic of china taxation in march 2007 the national people s congress of china enacted the enterprise income tax law which became effective on january 1 2008 and amended on february 24 2017 and december 29 2018 respectively the modified enterprise income tax law provides that enterprises organized under the laws of jurisdictions outside china with their de facto management bodies located within china may be considered prc resident enterprises and therefore subject to prc enterprise income tax at the rate of 25 on their worldwide income the implementing rules of the enterprise income tax law further define the term de facto management body as the management body that exercises substantial and overall management and control over the business personnel accounts and properties of an enterprise table of contents addition sat circular 82 issued by the sat in april 2009 specifies that certain offshore incorporated enterprises controlled by prc enterprises or prc enterprise groups will be classified as prc resident enterprises if the following are located or resident in the prc a senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production operation and management b financial and personnel decision making bodies c key properties accounting books company seal minutes of board meetings and shareholders meetings and d half or more of the senior management or directors having voting rights while we do not currently consider our company or any of our overseas subsidiaries to be a prc resident enterprise there is a risk that the prc tax authorities may deem our company or any of our overseas subsidiaries as a prc resident enterprise since a substantial majority of the members of our management team as well as the management team of some of our overseas subsidiaries are located in china in which case we or the overseas subsidiaries as the case may be would be subject to the prc enterprise income tax at the rate of 25 on worldwide income if the prc tax authorities determine that our cayman islands holding company is a resident enterprise for prc enterprise income tax purposes a number of unfavorable prc tax consequences could follow one example is a 10 withholding tax would be imposed on dividends we pay to our non prc enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non prc enterprise shareholders from transferring our adss or class a ordinary shares furthermore dividends payable to individual investors who are non prc residents and any gain realized on the transfer of adss or class a ordinary shares by such investors may be subject to prc tax at a current rate of 20 subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in applicable tax treaties or under applicable tax arrangements between jurisdictions it is unclear whether if we are considered a prc resident enterprise holders of our adss or class a ordinary shares would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between china and other countries or areas that our cayman islands holding company is not deemed to be a prc resident enterprise holders of the adss and class a ordinary shares who are not prc residents will not be subject to prc income tax on dividends distributed by us or gains realized from the sale or other disposition of our class a ordinary shares or the adss however under bulletin 7 and sat circular 37 where a non resident enterprise conducts an indirect transfer by transferring taxable assets including in particular equity interests in a prc resident enterprise indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company the non resident enterprise being the transferor or the transferee or the prc entity which directly owned such taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer using a substance over form principle the prc tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing avoiding or deferring prc tax as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to prc enterprise income tax and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of 10 for the transfer of equity interests in a prc resident enterprise we and our non prc resident investors may be at risk of being required to file a return and being taxed under bulletin 7 and sat circular 37 and we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with bulletin 7 and sat circular 37 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars or to establish that we should not be taxed under these circulars see risk factors 151 risks relating to doing business in china 151 we and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in prc resident enterprises or other assets attributed to a chinese

guidance indicates that our adss which we have been approved for listing on the nyse will be readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states once they are so listed thus we believe that dividends we pay on our adss will meet the conditions required for these reduced tax rates since we do not expect that our class a ordinary shares will be listed on an established securities market in the united states we do not believe that dividends that we pay on our class a ordinary shares that are not represented by adss currently meet the conditions required for these reduced tax rates there also can be no assurance that our adss will continue to be readily tradable on an established securities market in later years a qualified foreign corporation also includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of table of contents income tax treaties with the united states in the event that we are deemed to be a prc resident enterprise under the enterprise income tax law we may be eligible for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the united states and prc or the treaty and if we are eligible for such benefits dividends we pay on our class a ordinary shares regardless of whether such shares are represented by adss would be eligible for reduced rates of taxation see taxation 151 people s republic of china taxation non corporate holders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to section 163 d 4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met you should consult your tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given your particular circumstances united states holders will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividends received from us if we are a passive foreign investment company in the taxable year in which such dividends are paid or in the preceding taxable year see 151 passive foreign investment company below to certain conditions and limitations including a minimum holding period requirement any prc withholding taxes on dividends may be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against your united states federal income tax liability for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit dividends paid on the adss or class a ordinary shares will be treated as income from sources outside the united states and will generally constitute passive category income the rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex you are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances of adss class a ordinary shares or rights to subscribe for adss or class a ordinary shares that are received as part of a pro rata distribution to all of our shareholders generally will not be subject to united states federal income tax passive foreign investment company based on the past and projected composition of our income and assets and the valuation of our assets including goodwill which we have determined based on the expected price of our adss in this offering we do not believe we were a passive foreign investment company or a pfic for our most recent taxable year and we do not expect to become a pfic in the current taxable year or in the foreseeable future although there can be no assurance in this regard general we will be a pfic for any taxable year in which at least 75 of our gross income is passive income or at least 50 of the value determined based on a quarterly average of our assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income this purpose passive income generally includes dividends interest royalties and rents other than royalties and rents derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and not derived from a related person we believe that the rents we derive from our leasing operations should qualify as derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and thus should not constitute passive income there can be no assurance however that the internal revenue service will not successfully assert a contrary position cash is treated as an asset that produces or is held for the production of passive income if we own at least 25 by value of the stock of another corporation for purposes of determining whether we are a pfic we will be treated as owning our proportionate share of the other corporation s assets and receiving our proportionate share of the other corporation s income however table of contents is uncertainty as to the treatment of our corporate structure and ownership of our consolidated vies for united states federal income tax purposes for united states federal income tax purposes we consider ourselves to own the equity of our consolidated vies if it is determined contrary to our view that we do not own the equity of our consolidated vies for united states federal income tax purposes for instance because the relevant prc authorities do not respect these arrangements we may be treated as a pfic determination of whether we are a pfic is made annually accordingly we may become a pfic in the current or any future taxable year due to changes in our asset or income composition the composition of our assets and income may be affected by how and how quickly we use our liquid assets and the cash raised in this offering because we have valued our goodwill based on the expected market value of our adss a decrease in the price of our adss may also result in our becoming a pfic if we are a pfic for any taxable year during which you hold our adss or class a ordinary shares you will be subject to special tax rules discussed below we are a pfic for any taxable year during which you hold our adss or class a ordinary shares and you do not make a timely mark to market election as described below you will be subject to special tax rules with respect to any excess distribution received and any gain realized from a sale or other disposition including a pledge and a deemed sale discussed in the following paragraph of adss or class a ordinary shares distributions received in a taxable year will be treated as excess distributions to the extent that they are greater than 125 of the average annual distributions received during the shorter of the three preceding taxable years or your holding period for the adss or class a ordinary shares under these special tax the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over your holding period for the adss or class a ordinary shares the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a pfic will be treated as ordinary income and the amount allocated to each other year will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for individuals or corporations as applicable for that year and the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the resulting tax attributable to each such year the determination of whether we are a pfic is made annually if we are a pfic for any taxable year in which you hold our adss or class a ordinary shares you will generally be subject to the special tax rules described above for that year and for each subsequent year in which you hold the adss or class a ordinary shares even if we do not qualify as a pfic in such subsequent years however if we cease to be a pfic you can avoid the continuing impact of the pfic rules by making a special election to recognize gain as if your adss or class a ordinary shares had been sold on the last day of the last taxable year during which we were a pfic you are urged to consult your tax advisor about this election lieu of being subject to the special tax rules discussed above you may make a mark to market election with respect to your adss or class a ordinary shares provided such adss or class a ordinary shares are treated as marketable stock the adss or class a ordinary shares generally will be treated as marketable stock if the adss or class a ordinary shares are regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market within the meaning of the applicable treasury regulations under current law the mark to market election may be available to holders of adss once the adss are listed on the nyse which constitutes a qualified exchange although there can be no assurance that the adss will be regularly traded for purposes of the mark to market election it is intended that only the adss and not the class a ordinary shares will be listed on the nyse consequently if you are a holder of table of contents ordinary shares that are not represented by adss you generally will not be eligible to make a mark to market election you make an effective mark to market election for each taxable year that we are a pfic you will include as ordinary income the excess of the fair market value of your adss at the end of the year over your adjusted tax basis in the adss you will be entitled to deduct as an ordinary loss in each such year the excess of your adjusted tax basis in the adss over their fair market value at the end of the year but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark to market election your adjusted tax basis in the adss will be increased by the amount of any income inclusion and decreased by the amount of any deductions under the mark to market rules in addition upon the sale or other disposition of your adss in a year that we are a pfic any loss will be treated as ordinary loss but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark to market election and any gain will be treated as ordinary income if you make a mark to market election any distributions that we make would generally be subject to the tax rules discussed above under 151 taxation of dividends except that the lower rate applicable to dividends received from a qualified foreign corporation discussed above would not apply if we are a pfic in the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or in the preceding taxable year you make a mark to market election it will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless the adss are no longer regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market or the internal revenue service consents to the revocation of the election you are urged to consult your tax advisor about the availability of the mark to market election and whether making the election would be advisable in your particular circumstances u s taxpayers can sometimes avoid the special tax rules described above by electing to treat a pfic as a qualified electing fund under section 1295 of the code however this option is not available to you because we do not intend to prepare or provide you with the tax information necessary to permit you to make this election we are a pfic for any taxable year during which you hold our adss or class a ordinary shares and any of our non united states subsidiaries is also a pfic you will be treated as owning a proportionate amount by value of the shares of the lower tier pfic for purposes of the application of the pfic rules you will not be able to make the mark to market election described above in respect of any lower tier pfic you are urged to consult your tax advisors about the application of the pfic rules to any of our subsidiaries will generally be required to

federal income tax consequences of holding adss or class a ordinary shares if we are a pfic in any taxable year taxation of capital gains for united states federal income tax purposes you will recognize taxable gain or loss on any sale or exchange of the adss or class a ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized for the adss or class a ordinary shares and your tax basis in the adss or class a ordinary shares subject to the discussion under 151 passive foreign investment company above such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long term capital gain or loss if you have held the adss or class a ordinary shares for more than one year long term capital gains of non corporate united states holders including individuals are eligible for reduced rates of taxation the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations any gain or loss recognized by you will generally be treated as united states source gain or loss however if prc tax is imposed on any gain for instance because we are treated as a prc resident enterprise for prc tax purposes or the prc treats the sale or exchange as an indirect transfer of prc taxable assets and if you are eligible for the table of contents of the treaty you may elect to treat such gain as prc source gain under the treaty if you are not eligible for the benefits of the treaty or if you fail to make the election to treat any gain as prc source then you generally would not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any prc tax imposed on the disposition of adss or class a ordinary shares unless such credit can be applied subject to applicable limitations against tax due on other income derived from foreign sources information reporting and backup withholding in general information reporting will apply to dividends in respect of our adss or class a ordinary shares and the proceeds from the sale exchange or other disposition of our adss or class a ordinary shares that are paid to you within the united states and in certain cases outside the united states unless you are an exempt recipient a backup withholding tax may apply to such payments if you fail to provide a taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fail to report in full dividend and interest income withholding is not an additional

take a contrary view to its opinion if the company s corporate structure and contractual arrangements are found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations including revoking the business and operating licenses of the company levying fines on the company confiscating any

measurements accounting guidance establishes a three level fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when

of inputs are level 1 151 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level 2 151 include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace level 3 151 unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity guidance also describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities 1 market approach 2 income approach and 3 cost approach the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset assets and liabilities of the group primarily consist of

flows associated with each debt instrument discounted at the company s current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable terms as of december 31 2017 and 2018 the carrying values of the long term borrowings approximate their fair values as the long term borrowings interest rates approximate the rates currently offered by the company s bankers for similar debt instruments of

using the binomial option pricing model with the following assumptions used risk free rate of return expected dividend yield exercise multiple fair value of underlying ordinary share us 0 0231 0 1164 us 0 2479 0 9466 expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable peer public companies with a period of time close to the expected term of the company s options the risk free interest rate was estimated based on the yield to maturity of u s treasury bonds denominated in usd for a term consistent with the expected term of the company s options in effect at the option valuation date the expected exercise multiple was estimated as the average ratio of the stock price to the exercise price of when employees would decide to voluntarily exercise their vested options as the company did not have sufficient information of past employee exercise history it was estimated by referencing to a widely accepted academic research publication expected dividend yield is zero as the company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its shares and the company does not anticipate any dividend payments in the foreseeable future expected term is the contract life of the option fair value of the share options granted at the grant date amounted to rmb14 118 and rmb26 875 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 respectively since the exercisability is dependent upon the company s ipo and it is not probable that this performance condition can be achieved until the ipo is effective no compensation expense relating to the options was recorded for the

acquired in business combinations accounting standards codification asc 350 20 permits the group to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test using a two step approach if this is the case the two step goodwill impairment test is required if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the two step goodwill impairment test is not required the two step goodwill impairment test is required the first step compares the fair values of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step will not be required if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill this allocation process is only performed for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities an impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill in

elsewhere in this prospectus and is qualified in its entirety by and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed information and financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus in addition to this summary we urge you to read the entire prospectus carefully especially the risks of investing in our adss discussed under 147 risk factors 148 before deciding whether to invest in our adss this prospectus contains information from an industry report commissioned by us and prepared by frost amp sullivan beijing inc shanghai branch co or frost amp sullivan an independent market research firm to provide information on the cancer screening and detection market and our market position in this industry overview we are a biotechnology company focusing on early cancer screening and detection we market and sell a multi cancer screening and detection test that uses our innovative patented cancer differentiation analysis or cda technology and our proprietary cancer detection device or cda device in addition to early cancer screening and detection our cda technology has demonstrated potential to assist physicians in cancer diagnosis prognosis and recurrence our cda technology provides a comprehensive platform on which we have developed our cancer screening and detection test using our cda technology or cda test and our proprietary cda device our cda test can detect and assess an individual 146 s overall cancer risk with high accuracy including early stage cancer in addition we also offer tests that combine our cda test with auxiliary tests based on other cancer screening and detection technologies such as biomarker based tests using our proprietary algorithm which we refer to as combination tests when we refer to our technology or tests as a 147 cancer screening and detection 148 technology or test in this prospectus we refer to the detection and assessment of the risk of cancer occurrence not to cancer diagnosis our cda technology focuses on biophysical properties in human blood recent studies have shown that there is a correlation between certain biophysical properties including acoustical electrical magnetic nano mechanical and optical properties and cancer occurrence these studies have revealed that biophysical properties could be important non genetic aspects of the micro environment regulating the balance between normal cell growth and carcinogenesis cancerous growth which may lead to cancer occurrence biophysical properties 146 physical expressions of information in the blood can indicate risks of pre cancerous states and cancers these biophysical signals change over time as cancer occurs progresses or regresses our proprietary cda device uses an integrated sensor system to detect certain biophysical signals in blood samples after collecting data on these signals we use our cda technology and proprietary algorithm to measure and analyze these signals at multiple biological levels including the protein cellular and molecular levels and with multiple parameters including the overall cda value the protein tumor factor or ptf value and the cell tumor factor or ctf value according to frost amp sullivan we are one of the first biotechnology companies worldwide to focus on the detection and measurement of cancers 146 biophysical properties in our industry and related research fields our cda technology as well as circulating tumor cell or ctc circulating tumor dna or ct dna exosome messenger rna or mrnas and other emerging technologies are known as 147 next generation 148 cancer screening and detection technologies our cda technology provides a highly accurate early stage risk assessment of the occurrence of cancer as of september 30 2019 our cda technology had been shown in numerous retrospective validation studies to be able to detect the risk of 26 cancer types with high sensitivity and specificity rates these 26 cancers accounted for over 80 of the cancer incidences in china from 2013 to 2018 according to frost amp sullivan our cda technology requires only a standard blood sample from a tested individual which minimizes the inconvenience and invasive procedures and avoids the harmful side effects that are inherent to many other technologies table of contents we have established a test database that as of september 30 2019 consisted of over 140 000 blood samples of various age sex and disease groups our database included approximately 100 000 samples from our commercial cda based tests and approximately 40 000 samples from our research studies according to frost amp sullivan we ranked first in china and second worldwide among companies offering next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in terms of the number of clinical samples for cancer screening and detection as of june 30 2019 for purposes of these rankings we had approximately 35 000 clinical samples as of june 30 2019 which represented the historical aggregate number of participants enrolled in our research studies that were developed in clinical sites qualified by competent authorities such as the prc national medical products administration or the nmpa in addition among companies offering next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in china in 2018 we ranked first in terms of volume of commercial cancer screening and detection tests conducted and fifth in terms of revenue from commercial cancer screening and detection tests according to frost amp sullivan we have established two clinical laboratories in china and one clinical laboratory in the united states our principal laboratory is a licensed biomedical clinical laboratory located in lishui zhejiang province china where we perform our commercial cda based tests including our cda tests and combination tests as well as a variety of other tests including immunological and biochemical tests our laboratory in haikou hainan province china is a licensed genomics clinical laboratory where we perform gene sequencing tests in addition to these two clinical laboratories we also have a research and development center located in shanghai china where we develop our next generation cancer screening and detection technology and tests in the united states we have a clinical laboratory located in san jose california for which we obtained a certificate of registration under the u s clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or clia in march 2019 our san jose laboratory is equipped to perform our cda tests and biochemical tests we have entered into research agreements with u s universities and academic medical centers and we are in discussions with other u s hospitals medical institutions contract research organizations or cros managed care companies and other health organizations to conduct research studies on our cda technology in this laboratory we also plan to open a second u s clinical laboratory in philadelphia pennsylvania in 2020 as of september 30 2019 we had filed 210 patent applications globally among these 121 patents had been granted including 55 in greater china including seven in taiwan and 16 in the united states and 89 patent applications were pending in china the united states and nearly 20 other countries and regions our patent applications broadly cover apparatus and methods for early stage disease detection and they strategically encompass important specific embodiments of these apparatus and methods our patent portfolio is one of the world 146 s largest for early cancer screening and detection using next generation technologies according to frost amp sullivan we performed our first commercial cda based test in china in 2015 since then we have generated revenue in china for four consecutive years the number of commercial cda based tests we sold increased significantly from 19 336 in 2017 to 41 607 in 2018 and from 29 036 in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to 41 544 in the same period of 2019 our revenue from sales of cancer screening and detection tests predominantly cda based tests as well as genomics tests increased by 83 7 from rmb5 2 million in 2017 to rmb9 6 million us 1 3

financial measure in evaluating our business we consider and use adjusted net loss a non gaap measure as a supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance the presentation of this non gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u s gaap we define adjusted net loss as net loss adjusted to add back share based compensation expenses we believe that adjusted net loss helps to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that we add back to net loss we believe that adjusted net loss provides useful information about our operating results enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making the non gaap financial measure 147 adjusted net loss 148 is not defined under u s gaap is not presented in accordance with u s gaap and has limitations as an analytical tool one of the key limitations of using adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all of the items of income and expense that affect our operations share based compensation has been and may continue to be incurred in our business and is not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net loss further the non gaap financial measure 147 adjusted net loss 148 may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including peer companies and therefore their comparability may be limited we compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non gaap financial measure to the nearest u s gaap performance measure all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance this non gaap financial measure should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with u s gaap and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with u s gaap that are included elsewhere in this prospectus table of contents the table below sets forth a reconciliation of our net loss to adjusted net loss for the periods indicated year ended december 31 nine months ended september 30 share based compensation expenses adjusted net loss summary

adss involves significant risks you should consider carefully all of the information in this prospectus including the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment in our adss any of the following risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation in that case the trading price of our adss could decline and you may lose your entire investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and ability to pay dividends risks relating to our business and industry we are a development stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and may increase the probability that we will not be successful we commenced our operations in 2010 we achieved commercialization of our cda test and started generating revenue in china in 2015 we currently do not have commercial operations in the u s we are a development stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history and our history may not provide a meaningful basis for you to evaluate our business financial performance and prospects furthermore we may not have sufficient experience or resources to address the risks frequently encountered by development stage biotechnology companies which include our potential failure to achieve and maintain profitability acquire and retain customers and increase adoption of our cancer screening and detection tests 151 including primarily our cda test and combination tests namely a combination of our cda test and on an auxiliary basis biomarker based cancer screening and detection tests as well as genomics tests 151 by physicians key opinion leaders or kols including research scientists and doctors in the u s who are willing to validate our tests after research patients hospitals medical institutions healthcare payers and others in the medical community respond to competitive market conditions attract train motivate and retain qualified personnel protect our proprietary technologies and intellectual property rights secure a stable supply of blood samples to support our research and clinical studies keep up with evolving industry standards and market developments obtain and maintain the regulatory licenses certifications and approvals required for us to further market our cancer screening and detection tests and commercialize our cda device in china and to commercialize our tests and cda device in the united states increase the awareness of our tests and protect our reputation maintain adequate control of our operational costs and manage our relationships with our research partners if we are unsuccessful in addressing any one or more of these risks they could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and increase the probability that we will not be successful we have incurred losses each year since our inception we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we may not be able to achieve and maintain profitability although our revenue grew rapidly in recent years we have incurred losses each year since our inception for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 we incurred table of contents net losses of rmb39 3 million rmb42 3 million us 5 9 million and rmb68 7 million us 9 6 million respectively as of september 30 2019 we had an accumulated deficit of rmb242 9 million us 34 0 million to date we have financed our operations primarily with capital contributions from our shareholders short term non bank borrowings and loans from related parties we have devoted and expect to continue to devote substantially all of our resources to the research development and commercialization of our cda technology device and test we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future we cannot predict the extent of these future losses or when we may achieve profitability if at all if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from our business and control our costs and expenses to achieve and maintain profitability the value of your investment in us could be negatively affected our success depends heavily on the success of our cda technology and related cancer screening and detection test we derive our revenue primarily from our cda based tests which depend on our cda technology if we obtain relevant approvals from the nmpa to sell our cda device we also anticipate generating revenue from the sales of our cda device we believe that our commercial success will depend upon our ability to achieve and maintain market acceptance of our current or future cancer screening and detection tests which will depend on a number of factors including our ability to further validate the clinical utility and superiority of our cda technology by increasing its sensitivity and specificity and through research studies and accompanying publications the timing and scope of additional approvals from the nmpa for our cda device and test our ability to maintain these approvals acceptance of our cda test by physicians kols patients hospitals medical institutions healthcare payers and others in the medical community our ability to enter and develop the china hospital market for our cda device and test sufficient coverage and reimbursement by third party payers for our services which may depend on multiple factors such as the enforceability of relevant laws that mandate the coverage of cancer or pre cancer disease screening our ability to maintain and expand our customer base in china especially among insurance companies corporate customers and the hospital market our sales and marketing capabilities including our success in expanding our sales and marketing team and establishing our own sales network in china the amount and nature of competition from other early cancer screening and detection products and procedures our ability successfully to penetrate the u s market and negative publicity regarding our or our competitors 146 tests and technologies resulting from defects or errors if we are unsuccessful in addressing these or other factors that might affect the market acceptance of our tests our business and results of operations will suffer our ability to grow our china business is substantially dependent on our ability to penetrate the chinese hospital market in china we currently can only conduct our cancer screening and detection tests on our devices in our own certified laboratories given these restrictions our customer base is primarily direct customers such as corporations and life insurance companies as well as sales agents such as health management companies and table of contents medical device dealers but china 146 s largest market for cancer screening and detection tests is the hospital market in which patients go to chinese hospitals for cancer screening and other medical tests currently we cannot conduct our tests in hospitals we have applied for an nmpa class iii medical device registration certificate for our cda devices to assist in multi cancer diagnosis if we receive this certificate together with an updated medical device manufacture license we would be permitted to place our devices within chinese hospitals 146 laboratories to conduct commercial tests there or sell our devices to the hospitals for the purposes of assisting in physicians 146 diagnosis of specified multiple cancers the timing for us to obtain this certificate or license is uncertain but we expect it to take at least three years even if we obtain the certificate and license we will need to successfully market our cda device and test to chinese hospitals our ability to grow our china business depends substantially on our ability successfully to penetrate the chinese hospital market and we cannot assure you as to when or whether we will be able to do so our plans to enter the u s market may not be successful currently we conduct commercial operations only in china and the substantial majority of our business assets management and employees are located in china we have only recently started our efforts to enter the u s market we obtained a california state license and a clia certificate of registration for our laboratory in san jose california in march 2019 we are seeking voluntary accreditation of our san jose laboratory by the college of american pathologists or cap our u s operations are currently focused on collaborating with u s health organizations to conduct research tests of our cda technology we plan to open a new laboratory in philadelphia pennsylvania in 2020 and we will seek to obtain clia certification a pennsylvania state license and accreditation from cap for this laboratory although our strategy is to expand our u s operations and eventually commence commercial sales of our cda based tests in the united states this strategy is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including our ability to secure research agreements with reputable u s hospitals medical institutions and other health organizations to conduct research studies for our test our ability to obtain sufficient blood samples for our planned research tests the substantial costs and time required for u s research tests and clinical studies positive outcomes of our u s research tests sufficient to support the clinical validity safety and effectiveness of our test in the u s market u s federal and state regulatory risks including our ability to commence marketing of our cda test as an ldt without premarket clearance market authorization or approval from the united states food and drug administration or the fda and our ability to comply with all applicable fda laws and other regulations and costs and timing of obtaining relevant development of a u s infrastructure including sales and marketing resources sufficient to commercialize our substantial competition in the u s cancer screening and detection market including from companies with substantially greater resources than we have and market acceptance of our test in the u s our ability to successfully address these factors and penetrate the u s market as well as the costs and timing of these efforts are highly uncertain we expect that our commercial activities and revenues will continue to be derived solely from china for the foreseeable future our industry is subject to rapid change and other companies or institutions may develop and market novel or improved early cancer screening and detection methods which may make our cda technology less competitive or obsolete our cda based tests depend on the effectiveness of our cda technology and we may be unable to maintain the competitiveness of this technology our industry is characterized by rapid changes including table of contents technological and scientific breakthroughs frequent new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards all of which could make our current cda based test obsolete in recent years there have been numerous advances in technologies relating to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer we must continuously enhance our cda technology and develop new tests to keep abreast of evolving standards of early cancer screening and detection other companies and institutions may possess significantly greater financial and other resources and research and development capabilities than we do these other companies and institutions may devote significant resources to develop new methods of detecting cancers and pre cancer symptoms and these methods and related tests could represent significant competition for our cda technology and cancer screening and detection test or even render our cda technology obsolete we may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors because their products and services may be superior they may also have more expertise experience financial resources or stronger business relationships in developing and marketing their products and services more mature technologies and products greater market adoption and greater brand recognition than we do further even if we do develop new marketable tests or services our current and future competitors may develop tests and services that are more commercially attractive than ours and they may bring those tests and services to market sooner than we are able to we require substantial funding for our operations if we cannot raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms our business financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected we require substantial capital to expand our business pursue strategic investments and for other reasons including to increase our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption of our cancer screening and detection tests and address competitive developments expand our technologies into other types of cancer screening and detection products such as our cda test 146 s application in assistance in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence acquire or invest in technologies seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our cancer screening and detection tests and devices conduct research studies for our cda test and any additional cancer screening and detection tests maintain expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio hire and retain additional personnel such as scientific quality control and marketing personnel develop acquire and improve operational financial and management information systems including personnel to support our product development and help us comply with our obligations as a public company add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development programs and finance general and administrative expenses we plan to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to fund our research studies in china and the u s the development of new cancer screening and detection tests and technologies the expansion of our marketing and sales channels in china and our clinical laboratory expansion in the u s the net proceeds of this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake accordingly we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings debt financings or other sources further financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all if we fail to raise capital as and when needed it would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy in addition if we raise funds by issuing debt securities or incurring additional borrowings the terms of the debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations and we may be unable to repay the indebtedness when due if we raise funds by issuing equity securities your investment in our company could be diluted table of contents as of september 30 2019 we had short term debt of rmb29 7 million us 4 1 million including a short term loan borrowed by our prc subsidiary anpac bio medical technology shanghai co ltd or anpac shanghai from a third party micro loan company and our convertible loans from our related party zhijun we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand anticipated equity contributions of our shareholders borrowings our anticipated cash flows generated from our operating activities and financial support from our founder and chairman dr chris chang yu will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes for at least the next 12 months however our estimate as to how long we expect these financial resources to be sufficient to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong further changing circumstances some of which may be beyond our control could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors including the scope progress timing costs and results of the development of our cda technology and our other product the costs of expanding our laboratory operations and offerings including our sales and marketing efforts our rate of progress in and costs of the sales and marketing activities associated with encouraging adoption of our cancer screening and detection tests our rate of progress in and cost of research and development activities associated with our cda test and any additional cancer screening and detection tests the impact of competing technological and market developments costs related to entering the u s market the costs of preparing filing and prosecuting patent applications maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims the costs timing and outcome of obtaining regulatory approvals and changes in regulatory policies or laws that may affect our operations and the costs of operating as a public company we have recorded net current liabilities and negative cash flows from operating activities and may continue to do so we had net current liabilities of rmb17 4 million rmb50 6 million us 7 1 million and rmb70 5 million us 9 9 million as of december 31 2017 and 2018 and september 30 2019 respectively we cannot assure you that we will not continue to have net current liabilities positions in the future which would expose us to liquidity risk our future liquidity and ability to make the additional capital investments necessary for our operations and business expansion will depend primarily on our ability to maintain sufficient cash generated from operating activities and to obtain adequate external financing there can be no assurance that we will have such cash from operating activities or that we will be able to renew existing loan facilities or obtain other sources of financing we have experienced significant cash outflow from operating activities since our inception we had net cash used in operating activities of rmb21 6 million rmb31 1 million us 4 4 million and rmb32 6 million us 4 6 million in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 respectively our cost of continuing operations could further reduce our cash position and an increase in our net cash outflow from operating activities could adversely affect our operations by reducing the amount of cash we have available to meet the cash needs for operating our business and to fund our investments in our business table of contents our operating results may fluctuate significantly which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide our operating results may fluctuate significantly which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results these fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the level of demand for our cancer screening and detection tests which may vary significantly the timing and cost of and level of investment in research development regulatory approval and commercialization activities relating to our cda technology and our cancer screening and detection tests and device which may change from time to time the volume customer mix and product mix for our cancer screening and detection tests the introduction of new cancer screening and detection tests and services by us or others in our industry expenditures that we may incur to acquire develop or commercialize additional tests devices and technologies coverage and reimbursement policies with respect to our cancer screening and detection tests and tests that compete with our test changes in government regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies and general market conditions and other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors the cumulative effects of the factors discussed above could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our annual operating results as a result comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance if our cancer screening and detection tests or our competitors 146 comparable tests do not meet customer expectations our operating results reputation and business could suffer our success depends on the market 146 s confidence in our ability to provide reliable high quality cancer screening and detection tests we believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to defects or errors in our tests in particular if our tests fail to accurately detect the risk of pre and early stage cancers from blood samples and we cannot guarantee that our test will meet their expectations we may be subject to legal claims arising from any defects or errors in our tests furthermore if comparable tests offered by competing companies fail to perform to expectations consumers may have lower confidence in cancer screening and detection tests in general as a result the failure of our tests or our competitors 146 tests to perform as expected could significantly impair our operating results business prospects and reputation we do not carry product liability or professional liability insurance if we were to be sued for product liability or professional liability we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources we could face product liability claims if someone alleges that our cancer screening and detection tests gave inaccurate or misleading information regarding the patient 146 s risk of cancer or otherwise failed to perform as designed a claimant could allege that our test results caused unnecessary treatment or other costs or resulted in the patient missing the best opportunity or timing for treatment a patient could also allege other mental or physical injury or that our testing provided inaccurate or misleading information concerning the screening and detection assistance in diagnosis prognosis or recurrence of or available therapies for a cancer or other diseases we may also be subject to liability for errors in a misunderstanding of or inappropriate reliance upon table of contents the information we provide in the ordinary course of our business activities product liability or professional liability claims could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend and could divert our management 146 s attention we do not carry product liability or professional liability insurance even if we purchase these kinds of insurance the insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability or professional liability claims any product liability or professional liability claim brought against us with or without merit could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage additionally any product liability or professional liability lawsuit could damage our reputation or cause our research partners to terminate existing agreements and cause potential research partners to seek other partners or cause us to lose our current or potential customers any of these developments could adversely impact our results of operations business prospects and financial condition we may be subject to liability claims for defective services provided by third party physical checkup centers which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our results of operations in addition to our cda based tests we also provide annual physical checkup packages to our customers we typically outsource the physical checkup services in these packages other than cda based tests to third party physical checkup centers as a result the administration of the physical checkup services by these third parties may subject us to litigation and liability for personal damages to consumers potential judgments settlements or costs relating to these claims complaints or lawsuits could subject us to significant fees and costs in defending ourselves adversely affecting our results of operations in addition our business reputation and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity in connection with these liability claims we may be unable to support demand for our cancer screening and detection tests and manage our future growth effectively which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy since our inception we have experienced rapid growth and we anticipate further growth in our business operations our growth could strain our organizational administrative and operational infrastructure as the sales volume of our cancer screening and detection tests grows we will face increased demands on our capacity and efficiency for sample intake testing results analysis and other laboratory operations quality control customer service and general workflow management processes to effectively manage our future growth we plan to continue to improve our technology as well as our operational financial and management controls we also plan to hire train and manage additional qualified scientists laboratory technicians and sales and customer service personnel we will also need to maintain the quality and expected turnaround time of our tests the time and resources required for these improvements and failure to achieve them in a timely and effective manner could adversely affect our operations making it difficult for us to execute our business strategy we have limited selling and marketing resources and limited sales marketing customer support manufacturing and commercial laboratory experience which may restrict our success in commercializing our cancer screening and detection tests to grow our business as planned we must expand our sales marketing customer support manufacturing and commercial laboratory management capabilities which will require developing and administering our commercial infrastructure and or collaborative commercial arrangements and partnerships we have limited experience in these respects and we may encounter difficulties in retaining and managing the specialized workforce that these activities require for example our customer base is large and diverse which requires us to retain a sales team with established industry expertise and experience we rely on third party suppliers for the supply of blood samples for our tests and for reagents that we use in the auxiliary biomarker based tests that form part of our combination tests we engaged third parties to conduct substantially all of the biomarker based tests as part of our combination tests in 2017 and 2018 we have recently phased out this outsourcing arrangement and are performing our combination tests entirely in house we also rely on contract manufacturers that manufacture table of contents key components of our cda device while we primarily rely on our own sales and marketing personnel to market our tests we also engage sales agents including companies we invested in however we may not be able to effectively manage and maintain our relationships with these third parties including ensuring their compliance with our controls and procedures our future growth will also impose significant added responsibilities on our management if we fail to meet these demands it would negatively affect our business growth and profitability we may seek to partner with others to assist us with our sales marketing and manufacturing functions however we may be unable to find appropriate third parties that meet our requirements in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us in addition our third party business partners may not perform as we expect or our arrangements with them may otherwise prove to be detrimental to our results our third party arrangements may also be terminated prematurely including due to factors out of our control as a result of such developments our business and prospects may be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain qualified key management scientists staff and consultants our ability to implement our business plan may be adversely affected we are highly dependent upon certain of our key management scientists staff and consultants particularly dr chris yu our founder and chief executive officer and dr he yu our co founder and chief medical officer dr chris yu dr he yu and each of our key management and scientific personnel may terminate his or her employment with us if we lose any of our key management and scientific personnel we may be unable to find replacements suitable to us the loss of their services could significantly delay or prevent our achievement of our technology development sales and other business objectives we do not carry any key man life insurance in addition we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies universities governmental entities and other research institutions our limited operating history and the uncertainties attendant to being a development stage biotechnology company with limited capital resources could limit our ability to attract and retain personnel we may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan our future success depends on our ability to promote our brand and protect our reputation we believe that enhancing and maintaining awareness of our 147 anpac 148 brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our cancer screening and detection tests gaining trust for our testing services and attracting new customers successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the quality of the services we offer and the effectiveness of our branding and marketing efforts currently we rely primarily on our own sales and marketing team to promote our brand and our cancer screening and detection tests and we also engage sales agents including companies we invested in we expect our branding and marketing efforts will require us to incur significant expenses and devote substantial resources we cannot guarantee that our marketing efforts will be successful brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue in the near term and even if they do any revenue increases may not offset the expenses we incur to promote our brand our failure to establish and promote our brand and any damage to our reputation will hinder our growth in addition some companies that we established in china together with third parties 151 over which we do not have effective control 151 share with us the 147 anpac 148 trading name and its chinese characters that we use and they at times act as sales agents for our cda test given this shared use any negative publicity related to these companies as well as their products and services whether with merit or not and whether or not related to us could adversely impact our brand and reputation furthermore negative publicity about other market players or isolated incidents such as fraudulent behaviors whether or not factually correct may result in negative perception of the early cancer screening and detection industry as a whole and undermine the credibility we have established which may negatively affect our business and results of operations if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property our business would be harmed we rely on patent protection as well as trademark trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary devices tests and technologies all of which table of contents provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights if we fail to effectively protect and or maintain our patented devices tests and technologies our competitive position and prospects could be adversely affected furthermore we could incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our patents and other intellectual property we cannot assure investors that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be issued if at all it is possible that for any of our patents that have been issued or that may be issued in the future our competitors may design their products around our patented technologies further we cannot assure you that other persons will not challenge any patents granted to us or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid enforceable and or infringed we cannot guarantee you that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications any successful third party challenge or challenges to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of these patents or these patents being interpreted narrowly and or in a manner adverse to our interests our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors and or market entrants may be diminished because of these uncertainties for these and other reasons our intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantage for example we might not have been the first to make the inventions claimed or disclosed by our pending patent applications or issued patents we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions to determine the priority of these inventions we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office which could result in substantial costs to us and could possibly result in a loss or narrowing of our patent rights we cannot assure you that our patent applications or granted patents will have priority over any other patent or patent application involved in such a proceeding or will be held valid as an outcome of the proceeding other persons may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or duplicate any of our products and technologies which can potentially impact our market share and revenue regardless of whether our intellectual property rights are successfully enforced against these other persons it is possible that our pending patent applications will not result in granted patents and even if these pending patent applications are issued as patents they may not provide intellectual property protection of commercially viable products or product features may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties patent offices and or the courts we may be unaware of or unfamiliar with prior art and or interpretations of prior art that could potentially impact the validity or scope of our patents or pending patent applications or patent applications that we intend to file we take efforts and enter into agreements with employees consultants collaborators and advisors to confirm ownership and chain of title in intellectual property rights however an inventorship or ownership dispute could arise that may permit one or more third parties to practice or enforce our intellectual property rights including possible efforts to enforce rights against us we may elect not to maintain or pursue intellectual property rights that at some point in time may be considered relevant to or enforceable against a competitor we may not develop additional proprietary products and technologies that are patentable or we may develop additional proprietary products and technologies that are not patentable the patents or other intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business and we apply for patents relating to our devices tests and technologies as we deem appropriate however we or our representatives or their agents may fail to apply for patents on important devices tests and table of contents technologies in a timely fashion or at all or we or our representatives or their agents may fail to apply for patents in potentially relevant jurisdictions to the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection or is found to be invalid or unenforceable we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct or indirect competition if our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage over our competitors 146 products our competitive position and our business could be adversely affected in addition to patent protections we also try to protect our trade secrets know how and other proprietary information through non disclosure and confidentiality provisions in our agreements with parties who have access to them such as our employees consultants and research partners these agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets know how and or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized uses or disclosure or other breaches of the provisions and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized uses or disclosure moreover if a party having an agreement with us has an overlapping or conflicting obligation to a third party our rights in and to certain intellectual property could be undermined in addition monitoring unauthorized disclosure and uses of our trade secrets is difficult and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure and uses are or will be adequate if we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets it would be expensive and time consuming and the outcome would be unpredictable and any remedy may be inadequate in addition courts outside the united states may be less willing to protect trade secrets in addition competitors could purchase our devices and tests and attempt to replicate and or improve some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts willfully infringe our intellectual property rights and design their devices and tests around our protected technologies or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights if our intellectual property does not adequately protect our market share against competitors 146 devices and tests our competitive position could be adversely affected as could our business we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents which could be expensive time consuming and unsuccessful competitors may infringe our patents in the event of infringement or unauthorized use we may file one or more infringement lawsuits which can be expensive and time consuming an adverse result in any such litigation proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated being found to be unenforceable and or being interpreted narrowly adverse results of these types could also put our patent applications at risk of not being issued and or impact the validity or enforceability positions of our other patents furthermore because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that part of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure many of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources they are therefore likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could in addition the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations continue our internal research programs pursue obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or enter into research and development partnerships that would help to validate and commercialize our tests in addition patent litigation can be very costly and time consuming an adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us or any of our future development partners to loss of our proprietary position expose us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all table of contents we may be subject to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and if determined adversely against us could materially disrupt our business the validity enforceability and scope of intellectual property rights protection in biotechnology industries particularly in china are uncertain and still evolving we cannot be certain that our devices tests and technologies do not or will not infringe patents copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims alleging infringement of patents trademarks or copyrights or misappropriation of creative ideas or formats or other infringement of proprietary intellectual property rights any such proceeding and claims could result in significant costs to us and divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel from the operation of our business these types of claims could also potentially adversely impact our reputation and our ability to conduct business and raise capital even if we are ultimately absolved of all liability moreover third parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive relief against us which could block our ability to offer one or more devices or tests and could result in a substantial award of damages against us in addition since we may indemnify customers or collaboration partners we may have additional liability in connection with any infringement or alleged infringement of third party intellectual property intellectual property litigation can be very expensive and we may not have the financial means to defend ourselves or our customers or collaboration partners because patent applications can take many years to issue there may be pending applications some of which are unknown to us that may result in issued patents upon which our devices tests or proprietary technologies may infringe moreover we may fail to identify issued patents of relevance or incorrectly conclude that an issued patent is invalid or not infringed by our technology or any of our devices or tests there is a substantial amount of litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in our industry if a third party claims that we or any of our customers or collaboration partners infringe upon a third party 146 s intellectual property rights we may have to seek to obtain licenses that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all abandon any product alleged or held to infringe or redesign our products or processes to avoid potential assertion of infringement pay substantial damages including in exceptional cases treble damages and attorneys 146 fees if a court decides that the device test or proprietary technology at issue infringes upon or violates the third party 146 s rights pay substantial royalties or fees or grant cross licenses to our technology and defend litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources we may be subject to claims that our employees consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties some of our employees were previously employed at other life science companies including our potential competitors although we try to ensure that our employees consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know how of others in their work for us and we are not currently subject to any claims that our employees consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties we may in the future be subject to such claims litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel which could adversely impact our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees table of contents if our laboratories and other facilities become damaged or inoperable our ability to conduct our laboratory analysis and our research and development efforts may be jeopardized we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from cancer screening and detection tests conducted at our laboratory located in lishui zhejiang province china we also intend to sell our cda device in china after obtaining relevant approvals from the nmpa we use our own facilities in lishui to assemble our cda device in addition to engaging third party contract manufacturers to manufacture its key components in the united states we plan to market our cda test initially as an ldt and we intend to perform all our research and commercial tests in our own laboratory in san jose as well as in our proposed new laboratory in philadelphia after it is established our facilities and equipment or those of our third party contract manufacturers could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man made disasters including fire earthquake power loss communications failure or terrorism these types of developments could render it difficult or impossible for us to operate our cancer screening and detection tests and assemble our device for some period of time if we are unable to perform our tests or to reduce the backlog of analysis that could develop if our facilities are inoperable for even a short period of time it could result in a loss of customers or harm to our reputation and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation we have not purchased any property insurance or business interruption insurance damages to or interruptions in the operations of our laboratories and other facilities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition furthermore our facilities and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work could be unavailable or costly and time consuming to repair or replace it would be difficult time consuming and expensive to rebuild our facilities and purchase our equipment to locate and qualify a new facility or equipment or to license or transfer our proprietary technology to a third party particularly in light of licensure and accreditation requirements even in the unlikely event that we are able to find a third party with such qualifications to enable us to conduct our test we may be unable to negotiate commercially reasonable terms security threats to our information technology infrastructure could expose us to liability and damage our reputation and business because our testing services and research and development activities enable us to access customers 146 and research partners 146 proprietary information it is essential to our business strategy that our information technology infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by our customers and research partners to be secure despite our security measures we may face cyber attacks that attempt to penetrate our network security sabotage or otherwise disable our research tests and services misappropriate our or our customers 146 and research partners 146 proprietary information which may include personally identifiable information or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services we have not purchased any cyber insurance any cyber attacks could negatively affect our reputation damage our network infrastructure and our ability to deploy our products and services harm our relationship with customers and research partners that are affected and expose us to significant financial liabilities we depend on third party suppliers sales agents service providers and research partners for different aspects of our business we depend on third parties for different aspects of our business including suppling blood samples for our research studies and reagents required for biomarkers used in our combination tests performing a portion of auxiliary biomarker based tests in our combination tests sales of our cancer screening and detection tests to our customers and collecting blood samples for our commercial cancer screening and detection tests selecting managing and supervising these third party suppliers sales agents and service providers requires significant resources and expertise poor performance by these third parties including their failure to provide services or products according to applicable legal and regulatory requirements the terms of our contracts or otherwise below standard could significantly and negatively affect the quality of our cancer screening and detection tests and damage our reputation decreases in the level of sales agents 146 purchases of tests from us for resale to the end customers could adversely affect our revenue growth in addition the service or cooperative agreements we have table of contents with third party suppliers sales agents and service providers are subject to a term and are not on an exclusive basis if these third parties do not continue to maintain or expand their cooperation with us we would be required to seek new suppliers and sales agents which could cause delays in services to us and negatively affect the quality and availability of our cancer screening and detection tests any of the above factors could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position in addition certain of our research partners in china which are primarily renowned hospitals and medical institutions collaborate with us and provide blood samples that we use to conduct various research studies these partners may cease cooperation with us in the future especially if they enter into similar agreements or arrangements with our competitors if we are unable to readily access sufficient blood samples to conduct our commercial tests and research studies we may be unable to compete effectively with other laboratories that have greater access to blood samples and our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed we rely on third party contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of key components of our cda devices we design and configure all of the key components of our cda device and have outsourced the manufacturing of these components of our cda devices to third party contract manufacturers our revenue is generated primarily from our cda tests conducted using our cda devices our contract manufacturers may fail to deliver these key components for reasons beyond our control for example they may encounter financial difficulties or experience disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns labor disputes or shortages raw material shortages cost increases or other similar reasons if they fail to timely deliver those key components for us to assemble our cda device or maintain the quality of their products our ability to conduct our commercial cda based tests could be adversely affected currently we do not have any long term or exclusive supply contracts with any of our contract manufacturers our contract manufacturers may cease to provide us with the key components of our cda devices since qualifying a new contract manufacturer could be costly and time consuming the termination of a contract manufacturer could cause disruption to our business and adversely impact our results of operations we rely on commercial courier delivery services to transport blood samples to our laboratory facilities in a timely and cost efficient manner and if these delivery services are disrupted our business will be harmed our business depends on our ability to quickly and reliably deliver test results to our customers we rely on commercial courier delivery services to transport blood samples to our laboratory facilities timely and cost efficiently blood samples are typically received within a few days in china for analysis in our laboratories disruptions in third party delivery service whether due to labor disruptions bad weather natural disaster terrorist acts or threats or for other reasons could adversely affect specimen integrity and our ability to process blood samples and conduct tests in a timely manner and to service our customers satisfactorily and ultimately our reputation and our business in addition if we are unable to continue to obtain expedited delivery services on commercially reasonable terms our operating results may be adversely affected if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations meet our reporting obligations or prevent fraud prior to this offering we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures our independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an audit of our icfr however in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 and the review of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of september 30 2019 and for the nine months ended september 30 2018 and 2019 we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified two 147 material weaknesses 148 in our icfr and other control deficiencies as defined in standards established by the united states public company accounting oversight board or the pcaob a 147 material weakness 148 is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in icfr such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or table of contents interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weaknesses and other control deficiencies identified were our company 146 s lack of sufficient accounting and financial reporting personnel with requisite knowledge and experience in application of u s gaap and the securities and exchange commission or sec rules and a lack of financial reporting policies and procedures that are commensurate with u s gaap and sec reporting requirements following the identification of the material weaknesses and other control deficiencies we have taken measures and plan to continue to take measures to remediate timely these deficiencies for details about remediation refer to 147 management 146 s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 151 internal control over financial reporting 148 for more details however the implementation of these measures may not fully address the material weakness and deficiencies in our icfr and we may be unable to conclude that they have been remediated our failure to correct the material weakness and control deficiencies or our failure to discover and address any other material weakness or control deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis as a result our business financial condition results of operations and prospects as well as the trading price of our adss may be materially and adversely affected additionally ineffective icfr could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions we may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods furthermore had our independent registered public accounting firm conducted an audit of our icfr it might have identified additional material weaknesses and deficiencies upon the completion of this offering we will become a public company in the united states subject to the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 section 404 will require that we maintain effective icfr and include a report from management on the effectiveness of our icfr in our annual report on form 20 f beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending december 31 2020 in addition once we cease to be an 147 emerging growth company 148 as such term is defined in the jobs act our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our icfr our management may conclude that our icfr is not effective moreover even if our management concludes that our icfr is effective our independent registered public accounting firm after conducting its own independent testing may issue an adverse opinion if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented designed operated or reviewed or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us in addition after we become a public company our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future we may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation in documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section 404 we may identify other weaknesses and deficiencies in our icfr in addition if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our icfr as these standards are modified supplemented or amended from time to time we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective icfr in accordance with section 404 if we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information this could in turn limit our access to capital markets harm our results of operations and lead to a decline in the trading price of our adss our business may suffer if we are unable to collect payments from our corporate customers on a timely basis we typically offer credit terms of one to three months to our sales agents and other corporate customers any downturn in the businesses of our sales agents and other corporate customers could reduce their willingness or ability to pay us the failure of any of our sales agents or other corporate customers to make timely payments could require us to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts for example we had allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of rmb18 000 rmb198 000 us 29 000 and rmb177 000 us 25 000 as of december 31 2017 and 2018 and september 30 2019 respectively we cannot guarantee that we will be able to collect these doubtful accounts as a result our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected table of contents we have granted and may continue to grant stock incentive awards which may result in increased share based compensation expenses we have adopted our 2019 share incentive plan or 2019 plan so that we can grant share based compensation awards to our directors officers employees and consultants to incentivize their performance and align their interests with ours the maximum number of class a ordinary shares that may be issued pursuant to all awards under our 2019 plan is 1 105 300 we have also separately issued options to our directors officers employees and consultants outside of our 2019 plan as of the date of this prospectus options to purchase 1 163 500 class a ordinary shares have been granted and are outstanding we believe the granting of stock incentive awards is of significant importance to our ability to attract and retain our management employees and consultants and we will continue to grant stock incentive awards to our management employees and consultants in the future as a result our expenses associated with share based compensation may increase which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition the granting vesting and exercise of the awards under these stock incentive plans will have a dilutive effect on your shareholding in our company we may be subject to litigation and other claims and legal proceedings and may not always be successful in defending ourselves against these claims or proceedings we are subject to lawsuits and other claims in the ordinary course of our business we have been and may in the future be subject to lawsuits and other legal proceedings brought by our customers competitors employees business partners investors other shareholders of the companies we invest in or other entities against us in matters relating to intellectual property rights contractual disputes competition claims and employment disputes among others we may also be subject to regulatory proceedings such as any non compliance with licensing requirements advertising practices and protection of data privacy of the tested individuals we may not be successful in defending ourselves and the outcomes of these lawsuits and proceedings may be unfavorable to us lawsuits and regulatory proceedings against us may also generate negative publicity that significantly harms our reputation which may adversely affect our customer base market position and our relationships with our research partners and other business partners in addition to the related costs managing and defending litigation and other legal proceedings and related indemnity obligations can significantly divert our management 146 s attention from operating our business we may also need to pay damages or settle lawsuits or other claims with a substantial amount of cash negatively affecting our liquidity as a result our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected we have limited business insurance coverage our business insurance is limited and we do not carry business interruption insurance to cover our operations we have determined that the costs of insuring for related risks and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical any uninsured damage to our facilities or technology infrastructures or disruption of our business operations could require us to incur substantial costs and divert our resources which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations risks relating to government regulations prc as a biotechnology company we are required to comply with extensive regulations and obtain and maintain a number of permits and licenses to carry on our business in china future government regulation may place additional burdens on our efforts to commercialize our cancer screening and detection tests and device as a biotechnology company we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in china violation of applicable laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business for example we table of contents are required to obtain a medical institution practice license from the prc national health commission or the nhc for our laboratories to conduct cancer screening and detection tests in china we also need to obtain a medical device manufacture license and a medical device registration certificate from the nmpa for the manufacturing and commercial use and sale of our cda device each of our current nhc medical institution practice licenses and our nmpa class ii medical device manufacture license and registration certificate has a five year term we are applying for a class iii medical device registration certificate from the nmpa after we obtain this license we will apply to update our medical device manufacture license to include the manufacture of class iii medical devices if we are unable to renew our existing licenses and certificates or obtain the class iii medical device license or update our medical device manufacture license or obtain or renew any other material permits or approvals required for our operations we may be unable to continue to sell our cancer screening and detection tests or to commercialize our cda device in china and as a result our business may be adversely affected in addition china 146 s regulatory framework governing biotechnology companies is subject to change and amendment from time to time any such change or amendment could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and prospects the prc government has introduced various reforms to the chinese healthcare system in recent years and may continue to do so with an overall objective of expanding basic medical insurance coverage and improve the quality and reliability of healthcare services the specific regulatory changes under the reforms still remain uncertain the implementing measures to be issued may not be sufficiently effective to achieve the stated goals and as a result we may not be able to benefit from these reforms to the level we expect if at all moreover the reforms could give rise to regulatory developments such as more burdensome administrative procedures which may have an adverse effect on our business and prospects if we are unable to maintain our medical device or laboratory related licenses and certificates our growth strategy may be compromised pursuant to the regulation on the supervision and administration of medical devices as amended by the prc state council in may 2017 medical devices are classified into three classes according to their risk levels class ii medical devices are medical devices with moderate risks that must be strictly controlled and regulated to ensure their safety and effectiveness class iii medical devices are medical devices with relatively high risks that must be strictly controlled and regulated through special measures to ensure their safety and effectiveness in addition the measures for the supervision and administration of the operation of medical devices as promulgated by the nmpa 146 s predecessor the china food and drug administration or the cfda in november 2017 regulate entities that engage in business activities involving medical devices in the prc in accordance with the medical devices 146 risk levels the class ii medical device registration certificate and the class iii medical device registration certificate are required for an entity to conduct business activities involving these medical devices we have obtained the class ii medical device registration certificate from the nmpa which allows us to conduct our tests in our licensed laboratories to perform our cda test outside of our laboratories and market them to chinese hospitals in december 2018 we applied for a class iii medical device registration certificate from the nmpa for our cda device we believe it will likely take at least three years for us to obtain this license from the nmpa after we obtain this license we will update our medical device manufacture license which we believe is a relatively straightforward procedure however there is no assurance that we will receive this nmpa approvals on a timely basis or at all if we fail to maintain and renew our class ii medical device registration certificate or if we are unable to obtain the class iii medical device license and update our medical device manufacture license our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected we believe our nhc medical institution practice license and nmpa class ii medical device registration certificate and manufacture license are effective and cover our current commercialized cda test which provides a cancer risk assessment however the prc laws and regulations governing cancer screening and detection table of contents devices and tests are subject to uncertainties and regulatory discretion including changes in interpretation and application such as in respect of restrictions on foreign investments in clinical laboratories there is also a risk that the relevant regulatory authorities could disagree with our assessment of the commercial activities permitted by our certificates and licenses for more information on this see 147 regulations 151 prc regulations 151 other significant prc regulations affecting our business activities in china 148 moreover if we begin to commercialize our cda test for other purposes such as assisting in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence this regulatory uncertainty and risk would be greater if the relevant regulatory authorities were to assert that our current or future commercial cancer screening and detection tests were not permitted by our licenses or revoke any of our nmpa or nhc licenses and certificates and require us to take remedial actions to their satisfaction or if we were unable to obtain amended or additional required licenses or approvals then our business and financial results would be adversely affected we are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review and to future changes in laws regulations or enforcement policies in china we are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review in relation to our laboratories and our medical devices even if the nmpa grants our application for a class iii medical device registration certificate and allows us to update our medical device manufacture license accordingly or if we successfully maintain and renew our class ii medical device manufacture license and registration certificate our cda device will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements in addition there could be a subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with our device including problems with third party manufacturers or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements including in respect of our conducting of cancer screening and detection tests for example if we were found to have conducted any of these tests in premises other than a licensed laboratory we could be subject to confiscation of revenue from the relevant tests as well as other penalties for more information on this see 147 regulations 151 prc regulations 151 regulation on medical devices and medical institutions 151 medical institutions laws and regulations 148 any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources and could result in adverse government actions including penalties on us and negative publicity on our brand moreover laws regulations and enforcement policies in china including those regulating medical institutions devices and supplies are evolving changes in these areas could impose more stringent requirements on us including fines or other penalties and increase our compliance and other operating costs changes in government regulations could also prevent limit or delay regulatory approvals in relation to our cda device if we are unable to maintain regulatory compliance any regulatory approval that has been obtained may be lost and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in addition regulatory changes may relax certain requirements that could benefit our competitors or lower market entry barriers and increase competition further regulatory agencies in china may periodically and sometimes abruptly change their enforcement practices any litigation or governmental investigation or enforcement proceedings against us in china may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention negative publicity damage to our reputation and decline in the price of our adss the absence of patent linkage patent term extension and data and market exclusivity for nmpa approved medical products could increase the risk of early generic competition against our tests in china the life of a patent and the protection it affords are limited under prc law currently while certain foreign laws regulate patent term extension patent linkage to products to delay generic entry or extension of data exclusivity often referred to as regulatory exclusivity in certain circumstances china does not have any effective law or regulation in these aspects chinese regulators have set out a framework for delaying generic launches by adding patent linkage and data exclusivity into the chinese regulatory regime as well as for establishing a pilot program for patent term extension however these measures will require the adoption of table of contents specific regulations and to date no such regulations have been adopted if we are unable to obtain patent term extension or if such extension is shorter in length than requested our competitors may obtain approval of competing products prior to or following our patent expiration and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed any change in the regulations governing the use of personal data in china which are still under development or any data leakage or unauthorized use of data by third parties could adversely affect our business and reputation we provide early cancer screening and detection services to tens of thousands of individuals in china as a result we have access to these tested individuals 146 personal data including their age gender disease status and medical records we use this personal data internally to expand our test database and improve the clinical utility of our cda technology chinese regulations governing the collection and use of personal data are still under development we believe that there is no prc legal restriction on our internal use of such data any change in the regulatory regime in this regard could potentially affect our ability with regard to the collection and use of these personal data which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover we may not be able to prevent third parties from illegally obtaining and misappropriating personal data of the tested individuals that we collect concerns about data leakage or unauthorized use of data by third parties even if unfounded could damage our reputation and negatively affect our results of operations united states we conduct our business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in regulations or violations of regulations may directly or indirectly reduce our revenue adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and harm our business the u s life sciences industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which we operate may change significantly and adversely to us in the future areas of the regulatory environment that may affect our ability to conduct business in the united states include u s federal and state laws relating to laboratory testing including the clia and state laboratory licensing laws the development testing use distribution promotion and advertising of research services kits and clinical diagnostics including certain ldts which are regulated by the fda under the u s federal food drug and cosmetic act or the fdca test ordering documentation of tests ordered billing practices and claims payment under the u s centers for medicare amp medicaid services or cms and the u s department of health and human services or hhs office of the inspector general enforcing those laws and regulations medical device and in vitro diagnostic or ivd clearance marketing authorization or approval fda 146 s enforcement discretion to not regulate the majority of ldts as ivds laboratory anti mark up laws which are laws or regulations that can limit the prices of medical tests the handling and disposal of medical and hazardous waste fraud and abuse laws such as the u s federal false claims act or fca the federal health care program anti kickback statute or aks the criminal health care fraud statute and stark law defined below and state equivalents occupational safety and health administration rules and regulations the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa and other u s federal and state medical data privacy and security laws table of contents the genetic information non discrimination act and similar state laws coverage and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement for research services kits clinical diagnostics and cellular therapies and medicare medicaid other governmental payers and private insurers reimbursement levels in particular the laws regulations and policies governing the marketing of an ldt and clinical diagnostic tests and services are extremely complex and in many instances there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations among other things pursuant to the fdca and its implementing regulations the fda regulates the research design testing manufacturing safety labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance authorization or approval marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices in the united states to ensure they are safe and effective medical devices are defined by the fdca to include among other things instruments and in vitro reagents or other similar or related articles which are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions in addition the fda regulates the import and export of medical devices most ldts however are not currently regulated as medical devices under fda 146 s current regulatory framework although components of ldts including for example instruments reagents and sample collection devices may be regulated as medical devices if we are subject to these fda requirements and do not comply or later become subject to these requirements and fail to adequately comply our business operations may be harmed these requirements may additionally cause delays in our ability to market and sell our products or services which may directly or indirectly reduce our revenue adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and harm our business we plan to market our cda test initially as an ldt and future changes in the fda 146 s enforcement discretion for ldts could subject our operations to much more significant regulatory requirements we plan to initially market our cda test in the united states as an ldt ldts have generally been considered to be tests that are designed developed validated and used within a single laboratory the fda has a policy of enforcement discretion with respect to ldts whereby the fda does not actively enforce its medical device regulatory requirements for these tests however in july 2014 the fda notified congress of its intent to modify in a risk based manner its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to ldts in october 2014 the fda issued two draft guidance documents stating that it intended to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to ldts in a risk based manner consistent with the existing classification of medical devices the fda halted finalization of the draft guidance documents in november 2016 to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach to ldts and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution however it is unclear if congress or the fda will modify the current approach to the regulation of ldts in a way that would subject our cda test to the enforcement of fda regulatory requirements the fda commissioner and the director of the center for devices and radiological health or cdrh have expressed significant concerns regarding disparities between ldts and ivds that have been reviewed and cleared authorized or approved by the fda the fda has also determined that certain ldts do not qualify for enforcement discretion because these tests pose higher risk to the public health if we market our test initially as an ldt in the united states and the fda were to determine that our test is not within the enforcement discretion policy for ldts for any reason including as a result of new rules policies or guidance or due to changes in law our laboratory and test may become subject to extensive fda requirements or otherwise impact our business these types of changes could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition if required the regulatory marketing authorization process required to bring our ldt into compliance may involve among other things successfully completing additional clinical validations and submitting to and obtaining from the fda pre market clearance 510 k authorization for a de novo petition or approval of a premarket approval application or pma furthermore pending legislative proposals if enacted such as the verifying accurate leading edge ivct development act of 2018 or valid act could create new or different regulatory and compliance burdens on us and could have a negative effect on our ability to keep products on the market or develop new products which could have a material effect on our business in the event that we market our test initially as an ldt in the table of contents united states and then the fda requires marketing authorization of our ldt in the future the fda ultimately may not grant any clearance authorization or approval requested by us in a timely manner or at all our proprietary cda device is an analytical instrument used as part of our cda test which may increase our risk that the fda concludes that our test does not qualify as an ldt while the fda has historically exercised enforcement discretion over the majority of ldts there are certain factors that have led to increased regulatory oversight one such factor is the use of customized equipment and reagents if the fda were to conclude that our cda device requires clearance market authorization or approval to be used as part of an ldt it could prevent us from being able to offer our test even if we submit our cda device for clearance authorization or approval the fda ultimately may not grant such clearance authorization or approval requested by us in a timely manner or at all offering our proprietary cancer screening and detection test from more than one laboratory may increase our risk that the fda concludes that our test does not qualify as an ldt while the fda has historically exercised enforcement discretion over the majority of ldts it has narrowly defined an ldt as a test that is designed manufactured and used within a single laboratory however the fda has not historically taken enforcement action against laboratories with multiple facilities that offer the same test if we offer our cda test from more than one of our laboratories the fda could conclude that our test no longer qualifies as an ldt because it is not used within a single laboratory if the fda were to conclude that our cancer screening and detection test is not an ldt that could prevent us from being able to offer our test until we receive appropriate fda clearance authorization or approval even if we submit for clearance authorization or approval the fda may not ultimately grant such clearance authorization or approval requested by us in a timely manner or at all failure to comply with u s federal or state laboratory licensing requirements and the applicable requirements of the fda or any other regulatory authority or accrediting body could cause us to lose the ability to perform our cda test in the united states experience disruptions to our business or become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions we are subject to clia a u s federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of disease any testing subject to clia regulation must be performed in a clia certified laboratory clia certification is also required in order for us to be eligible to bill u s state and u s federal healthcare programs as well as commercial payers for our tests we have obtained a clia certificate of registration for our laboratory in san jose california we are seeking voluntary accreditation of our san jose laboratory by cap and are awaiting cap inspection to receive cap accreditation and a clia certificate of accreditation for this laboratory we also plan to open a new laboratory in philadelphia pennsylvania in 2020 and will seek to obtain clia certification and cap accreditation for this laboratory to maintain our cap accreditation and clia certification we are subject to survey and unannounced inspection every two years we are required to maintain a california clinical laboratory license for our san jose laboratory to conduct testing we will be required to maintain a pennsylvania clinical laboratory license in order for our to be established philadelphia laboratory to conduct testing in addition some other states may require our california and philadelphia laboratories to be licensed there in order to accept blood samples from those states or may have such requirements in the future to maintain our state licenses we may be subject to survey and inspection every two years failure to comply with applicable clinical laboratory certification and licensure requirements including proficiency testing may result in a range of enforcement actions including suspension limitation or revocation of our cap accreditation clia certificate and or state licenses imposition of a directed plan table of contents action onsite monitoring civil monetary penalties criminal sanctions and revocation of the laboratory 146 s approval to receive medicare and medicaid payment for its services any of these enforcement actions or our failure to renew our clia certificate a state license or other accreditation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we were able to bring our laboratory back into compliance we could incur significant expenses and potentially lose revenue in doing so if we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory clearance or approvals in the united states or if we experience delays in receiving clearance or approvals our growth strategy may not be successful in the united states we plan to initially offer our cda test for clinical use as an ldt in our laboratory in san jose california because we developed this test and will offer this test solely for use within our laboratory we believe that we may market the test as an ldt under current fda enforcement policies the fda does not enforce its premarket clearance or approval requirements for certain ldts before commercialization the fda could disagree with this assessment however in which case we would be required to obtain clearance authorization or approval for our device and or test to continue marketing in addition a key element of our longer term business strategy is to place our cda device in other laboratories to broaden access to our technology and increase demand for our tests and any future tests that we may develop in order to distribute our cancer screening and detection test and device outside of our laboratory we will need to obtain fda clearance authorization or approval for our test and device the fda regulates medical devices including ivds that are sold and distributed in u s interstate commerce unless an exemption applies generally before a new medical device or a new use for a medical device may be sold or distributed in the united states the medical device must receive either a 510 k premarket notification clearance de novo marketing authorization or a pma approval from the fda as a result before we can market or distribute our device and test in the united states for use by other clinical testing laboratories we must first obtain fda 510 k clearance de novo marketing authorization or pma approval we have not yet applied for clearance marketing authorization or approval from the fda and need to complete additional validations before we are ready to apply we believe it would likely take two years or more to conduct the clinical studies and trials necessary to obtain clearance marketing authorization or approval from the fda to commercially launch our tests outside of our clinical laboratory once we apply we may not receive the fda clearance marketing authorization or approval for the commercial use of our device and test on a timely basis or at all the fda can delay limit or deny clearance authorization or approval of a device for many reasons including inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda that the products are safe or effective for their the fda 146 s disagreement with the design conduct or implementation of the clinical studies or the analysis or interpretation of data from preclinical studies analytical studies or clinical studies serious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced by participants in clinical studies the data from preclinical studies analytical studies and clinical studies may be insufficient to support clearance authorization or approval where required the inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks an advisory committee if convened by the fda may recommend against approval of a pma or other application or may recommend that the fda require as a condition of approval additional preclinical studies or clinical studies limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions or even if an advisory committee if convened makes a favorable recommendation the fda may still not approve the product table of contents the fda may identify deficiencies in our marketing application and in our or our collaborators 146 manufacturing processes facilities or analytical methods the potential for policies or regulations of the fda to change significantly in a manner rendering clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance authorization or approval and the fda may audit clinical study data and conclude that the data are not sufficiently reliable to support a pma application there are numerous fda personnel assigned to review different aspects of marketing submissions and uncertainties can be presented by their ability to exercise judgment and discretion during the review process during the course of review the fda may request or require additional data and information and the development and provision of these data and information may be time consuming and expensive the process of obtaining regulatory clearances authorizations or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and we may not be able to obtain these clearances authorizations or approvals on a timely basis or at all for our proposed products if we are unable to achieve clearance or approval or if other laboratories do not accept our device and test our ability to grow our business could be compromised clinical studies involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results in order to receive fda clearance marketing authorization or approval for the commercialization of our cda test and or device in the united states we must conduct at our own expense extensive analytical testing and clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of our device and test for the intended indication of use clinical testing is expensive can take many years to complete if at all and its outcome is uncertain failure can occur at any time during the clinical study process also our cda device and test may not prove to be safe and efficacious in the clinical studies and they may not meet all the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive the fda approval the results of our clinical studies may not support the clinical validation needed to offer our cancer screening and detection test in the u s in addition clinical claims for our test that are supported by the clinical studies results may not be commercially viable if we receive fda clearance marketing authorization or approval of our cda device and test we will continue to be subject to extensive fda regulatory oversight medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states if our cda device is cleared authorized or approved by the fda we will need to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and our failure to do so could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies any of these enforcement actions could also result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition we also cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action in the united states for example certain policies of the trump administration may impact our business and industry namely the trump administration has taken several executive actions including the issuance of a number of executive orders that could impose significant burdens on or otherwise materially delay the fda 146 s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking issuance of guidance and review and approval of marketing applications it is difficult to predict how these executive actions will be implemented and the extent to which they will affect the fda 146 s ability to exercise its regulatory authority if these executive actions impose constraints on the fda 146 s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course our business may be negatively impacted table of contents our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including non compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading we are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees misconduct by our employees could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the fda or non u s regulators comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the united states and abroad or report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us in particular sales marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud misconduct kickbacks self dealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion sales commission customer incentive programs and other business arrangements such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical studies which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation we currently have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct and our code of conduct and the other precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil criminal and administrative penalties including without limitation damages monetary fines individual imprisonment disgorgement of profits possible exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other u s federal healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm diminished profits and future earnings additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non compliance with the law and curtailment or restructuring of our operations which could have a significant impact on our business whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations we could incur substantial costs including legal fees and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations if we fail to comply with healthcare regulations we could face substantial enforcement actions including civil and criminal penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and patient privacy laws of both the u s federal government and the states in which we conduct our business the laws include but are not limited to the aks which prohibits among other things persons from soliciting receiving or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service for which payment may be made under u s federal healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid the fca which prohibits among other things individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment from medicare medicaid or other payers that are false or fraudulent and which may apply to entities like us which provide coding and billing information to customers hipaa which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and state law equivalents of each of the above u s federal laws such as anti kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payer including commercial insurers and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by u s federal laws thus complicating compliance efforts if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines table of contents and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any penalties damages fines curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws the risks cannot be entirely eliminated any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management 146 s attention from the operation of our business moreover achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable u s federal and state privacy security and fraud laws may prove costly our collection use and disclosure of individually identifiable information including health and or employee information is subject to u s state u s federal and foreign privacy and security regulations and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm the privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored maintained received or transmitted including electronically is a major issue in the united states and abroad while we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies legal standards for privacy including but not limited to 147 unfairness 148 and 147 deception 148 as enforced by the ftc and state attorneys general continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business recently there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about the activities of various government agencies and in the number of private privacy related lawsuits filed against companies concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention disclosure or security of personally identifiable information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws could damage our reputation and harm our business numerous foreign u s federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information or phi including state privacy and confidentiality laws including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches u s federal and state consumer protection and employment laws hipaa and european and other foreign data protection laws these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number may change frequently and sometimes conflict hipaa establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information including phi by health plans healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically or covered entities and their business associates which are persons or entities that perform certain services for or on behalf of a covered entity that involve creating receiving maintaining or transmitting phi penalties for violations of these laws vary for instance penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act or hitech vary significantly and can include civil monetary penalties of up to 57 051 per violation not to exceed 1 71 million per calendar year for each provision that is violated a single breach incident can result in findings of violations of multiple provisions leading to possible civil penalties in excess of 1 71 million in a single year violations of hipaa may also result in criminal penalties for example a person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of hipaa may face a criminal penalty of up to 50 000 and up to one year imprisonment in certain circumstances criminal fines up to 250 000 per violation and or up to ten years 146 imprisonment may be imposed the criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage personal gain or malicious harm responding to government investigations regarding alleged violations of these and other laws and regulations even if ultimately concluded with no findings of violations or no penalties imposed can consume company resources and impact our business and if public harm our reputation table of contents further various states such as california and massachusetts have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are not necessarily preempted by hipaa particularly if a state affords greater protection to individuals than hipaa where state laws are more protective we may have to comply with the stricter provisions in addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused the interplay of u s federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients and potentially exposing us to additional expense adverse publicity and liability further as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex these potential risks to our business could intensify changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data such as phi or personally identifiable information along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure could greatly increase our cost of providing our services decrease demand for our services reduce our revenue and or subject us to additional liabilities we may be exposed to liabilities under the united states foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and chinese anti corruption laws and any determination that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business or our reputation we are subject to the fcpa the fcpa generally prohibits us from making improper payments to non u s officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to the anti bribery laws of china our current customers include state owned enterprises and after we obtain the class iii medical device registration certificate we plan to sell our cda tests and devices to hospitals in china many of which are state owned as a result we may engage with chinese officials or persons of equivalent status during the ordinary course of our business we do not fully control the interactions that our employees and sales agents have with those officials or persons and they may try to increase sales volumes of our tests through means that constitute violations of the fcpa the prc anti bribery laws or other related laws as our business expands the applicability of the fcpa and other anti bribery laws to our operations will increase our procedures and controls to monitor anti bribery compliance may fail to protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or sales agents if we due to either our own deliberate or inadvertent acts or those of others fail to comply with applicable anti bribery laws our reputation could be harmed and we could incur criminal or civil penalties other sanctions and or significant expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business including our financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects risks relating to doing business in china changes in china 146 s economic political or social conditions or government policies and the current tensions in international economic relations could have an adverse effect on our business and operations most of our assets and operations are located in china accordingly our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by political economic and social conditions in china the chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects including the level of government involvement level of development growth rate control of foreign exchange allocation of resources evolving regulatory system and lack of sufficient transparency in the regulatory process while the chinese economy has experienced significant growth over past decades growth has been uneven both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and the rate of growth has been slowing since 2012 any adverse changes in economic conditions in china in the policies of the chinese government or in the laws and regulations in china could have a material adverse effect on china 146 s overall economic growth such developments could adversely affect our business and operating results lead to a reduction in demand for our table of contents cancer screening and detection test and adversely affect our competitive position the chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources some of these measures benefit the overall chinese economy but may also have a negative effect on us for example our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us recently there have been heightened tensions in economic relations between the united states and china the u s government has recently imposed and proposed to impose additional new or higher tariffs on products imported from china to penalize china for what it characterizes as unfair trade practices china has responded by imposing largely commensurate tariffs on products imported from the united states amid these tensions the u s government has imposed and may impose additional measures on entities in china including sanctions as a biotechnology company with operations primarily based in china as well as the united states our plan to commercialize our cda test in and export our cda device to the united states after obtaining relevant approvals from the fda could be adversely affected by these or future trade developments in addition increased protectionism and the risk of global trade war which result in weaker global trade and lower levels of economic activity could reduce the demand for our tests and adversely affect our business uncertainties with respect to china 146 s legal system could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations we conduct our businesses in china primarily through our prc subsidiaries our operations in china are governed by prc laws and regulations our prc subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in china the prc legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes unlike the common law system prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value the prc legal system is evolving rapidly and the interpretation of many laws regulations and rules may contain inconsistencies and the enforcement of these laws regulations and rules involves uncertainties from time to time we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights any administrative and court proceedings in china may be protracted resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention since prc administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems these uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore the prc legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules some of which are not published in a timely manner or at all but which may have retroactive effect as a result we may not always be aware of any potential violation of these policies and rules such unpredictability towards our contractual property and procedural rights could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the prc foreign investment law which may impose new burdens on us the prc foreign investment law or the fil was enacted by the national people 146 s congress of the prc on march 15 2019 and became effective on january 1 2020 which replaces the trio of previous laws regulating foreign investment in china namely the sino foreign equity joint venture enterprise law the sino foreign cooperative joint venture enterprise law and the wholly foreign invested enterprise law together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations this law has become the legal foundation for foreign investment in the prc the fil embodies an expected prc regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments the implementation rules to the foreign investment law were promulgated by the state council on december 26 2019 and became effective on january 1 2020 however uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation and implementation of the fil and its implementation table of contents rules which may adversely impact our corporate governance practice and increase our compliance costs for instance we might be required by governmental interpretations or implementing rules of the fil to adjust the corporate governance of certain of our prc subsidiaries in a five year transition period in addition the fil imposes information reporting requirements on foreign investors or foreign invested enterprises failure to take timely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or other regulatory compliance requirements under the fil may lead to rectification obligations penalties or other regulatory sanctions on us prc regulations of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to prc entities may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of the offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to our prc subsidiaries which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business we are an offshore holding company conducting our operations in china through our prc subsidiaries we may make loans to our prc subsidiaries or we may make additional capital contributions to our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china any loans by us to our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterpart of the prc state administration of foreign exchange or safe in addition a foreign invested enterprise shall use its capital pursuant to the principle of authenticity and self use within its business scope in march 2015 safe promulgated the circular on reforming the administration measures on conversion of foreign exchange registered capital of foreign invested enterprises or safe circular 19 which took effect and replaced certain previous safe regulations from june 1 2015 safe further promulgated the circular of the safe on reforming and regulating policies on the control over foreign exchange settlement of capital accounts or safe circular 16 which took effective on june 9 2016 and among other things amended certain provisions of safe circular 19 according to safe circular 19 and safe circular 16 the flow and use of renminbi capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign invested company is regulated such that renminbi capital may not be used for business beyond its business scope or to provide loans to persons other than affiliates unless otherwise permitted under its business scope safe circular 19 and safe circular 16 may limit our ability to transfer the net proceeds from this offering to our prc subsidiaries and convert the net proceeds into rmb in light of the various requirements imposed by prc regulations on loans to and direct investment in prc entities by offshore holding companies we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis if at all with respect to future loans to our prc subsidiaries or future capital contributions by us to our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china as a result uncertainties exist as to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our prc subsidiaries when needed if we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals our ability to use the proceeds we expect to receive from this offering and to capitalize or otherwise fund our prc operations may be negatively affected which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business we rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business as a holding company we conduct most of our business through our subsidiaries incorporated in china we may rely on dividends paid by these prc subsidiaries for our cash needs including the funds necessary to pay any dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses the payment of dividends by entities established in china is subject to limitations regulations in china currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in china as a result our prc subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends in addition if any of our prc table of contents subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf in the future the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us any limitations on the ability of our prc subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business our business benefits from certain financial incentives and discretionary policies granted by local governments expiration of or changes to these incentives or policies would have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the past local governments in the prc granted certain financial incentives from time to time to our prc subsidiaries as part of their efforts to encourage the development of local businesses the timing amount and criteria of government financial incentives are determined within the sole discretion of the local government authorities and cannot be predicted with certainty before we actually receive any financial incentive we generally do not have the ability to influence local governments in making these decisions local governments may decide to reduce or eliminate incentives at any time in addition some of the government financial incentives are granted on a project basis and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including completion of the specific project therein we cannot guarantee that we will satisfy all relevant conditions and if we do not we may be deprived of the relevant incentives we cannot assure you of the continued availability of the government incentives currently enjoyed by us any reduction or elimination of incentives would have an adverse effect on our results of operations government grant and subsidies we recognized for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 was rmb1 4 million rmb5 9 million us 825 000 and rmb2 6 million us 367 000 respectively under the prc enterprise income tax law or the eit law we may be classified as a prc resident enterprise for prc income tax purposes which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non prc shareholders or ads holders and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment under the eit law and its implementation rules an enterprise established outside china may be considered as a prc resident enterprise provided that its 147 de facto management body 148 is located within china according to the implementation rules 147 de facto management body 148 is interpreted as a body that exercises substantial and overall management and control over the business personnel accounts and properties of an enterprise in april 2009 the prc state administration of taxation or the sat issued the circular of the sat on issues relating to identification of prc controlled overseas registered enterprises as resident enterprises in accordance with the de facto standards of organizational management or sat circular 82 which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the 147 de facto management body 148 of a prc controlled enterprise incorporated offshore is located in china although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by prc enterprises or prc enterprise groups not those controlled by prc individuals or foreigners the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect sat 146 s general position on how 147 de facto management body 148 rule should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises according to sat circular 82 an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a prc enterprise or a prc enterprise group will be regarded as a prc tax resident by virtue of having its 147 de facto management body 148 in china and will be subject to prc enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met i the primary location of the day to day operational management is in china ii decisions relating to the enterprise 146 s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in china iii the enterprise 146 s primary assets accounting books and records company seals and board and shareholder minutes are located or maintained in china and iv at least 50 of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in china according to these rules and regulations we may be considered as a prc resident enterprise by the prc tax authorities for tax purposes and a number of unfavorable tax consequences could follow however the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the prc tax authorities and uncertainties table of contents with respect to the interpretation of the term 147 de facto management body 148 if the prc tax authorities determine that we are a prc resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes we will be subject to prc tax at a rate of 25 on our worldwide income which could materially reduce our net income and we may be required to withhold tax from dividends we pay at a rate of 10 in case to non prc enterprise shareholders including ads holders or 20 in case to non prc individual shareholders including ads holders in addition gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares or adss may be subject to prc tax at a rate of 10 in case of non prc enterprise shareholders including our ads holders or 20 in case of non prc individual shareholders including ads holders if such dividends or gains are deemed to be from prc sources any such prc tax liability may be reduced under an applicable tax treaty however it is unclear whether non prc shareholders including our ads holders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the prc in the event that we are treated as a prc resident enterprise any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in the adss we face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in prc resident enterprises by their non prc holding companies in february 2015 the sat issued the public notice regarding certain enterprise income tax matters on indirect transfer of properties by non tax resident enterprises or sat public notice 7 sat public notice 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company in addition sat public notice 7 provides certain criteria on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market sat public notice 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer of the taxable assets where a non resident enterprise conducts an 147 indirect transfer 148 by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company the non resident enterprise being the transferor or the transferee or the prc entity that directly owns the taxable assets may report such indirect transfer to the relevant tax authority using a 147 substance over form 148 principle the prc tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing avoiding or deferring prc tax as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to prc enterprise income tax and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of 10 for the transfer of equity interests in a prc resident enterprise both the transferor and the transferee may be subject to penalties under prc tax laws if the transferee fails to withhold the taxes and the transferor fails to pay the taxes however according to the aforesaid safe harbor rule the prc tax would not be applicable to the transfer by any non resident enterprise of adss of our company acquired and sold on public securities markets in october 2017 the sat issued the public notice on issues concerning the withholding of non resident enterprise income tax at source or sat public notice 37 which took effect on december 1 2017 according to sat public notice 37 where the non resident enterprise fails to declare the tax payable pursuant to article 39 of the eit law the tax authority may order it to pay the tax due within required time limits and the non resident enterprise shall declare and pay the tax payable within such time limits specified by the tax authority if the non resident enterprise voluntarily declares and pays the tax payable before the tax authority orders it to do so it shall be deemed that such enterprise has paid the tax payable in time we face uncertainties on the reporting and consequences of future private equity financing transactions share exchanges or other transactions involving the transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non prc resident enterprises the prc tax authorities may pursue such non resident enterprises with respect to a filing or the transferees with respect to withholding obligation and request our prc subsidiaries to assist in the filing as a result we and non resident enterprises in such transactions may become at risk of being subject to filing obligations or being taxed under sat public notice 7 and sat public notice 37 and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with them or to establish that we should not be taxed under these regulations which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations table of contents fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities changes in the value of the rmb against the u s dollar euro and other foreign currencies are affected by among other things changes in china 146 s political and economic conditions since july 2005 the rmb is no longer pegged to the u s dollar and the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the u s dollar in the medium to long term any significant revaluation of the rmb may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition and the value of and any dividends payable on our shares in u s dollar terms for example to the extent that we need to convert u s dollars we receive from this offering into rmb for our operations appreciation of the rmb against the u s dollar would have an adverse effect on rmb amount we would receive from the conversion conversely if we decide to convert our rmb into u s dollars for the purpose of paying dividends on our ordinary shares or for other business purposes appreciation of the u s dollar against the rmb would have a negative effect on the u s dollar amount available to us governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our cash balance effectively and affect the value of your investment the prc government imposes controls on the convertibility of the renminbi into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of china we receive substantially all of our revenues in renminbi under our current corporate structure our holding company incorporated in the bvi primarily relies on dividend payments from our prc subsidiaries to fund our cash and financing requirements under existing prc foreign exchange regulations payments of current account items including profit distributions interest payments and trade and service related foreign exchange transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of safe by complying with certain procedural requirements specifically under the existing exchange restrictions without prior approval of safe cash generated from the operations of our prc subsidiaries in china may be used to pay dividends to our company however approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of china to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies as a result we need to obtain safe approval to use cash generated from the operations of our prc subsidiaries to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than renminbi owed to entities outside china or to make other capital expenditure payments outside china in a currency other than renminbi in light of the flood of capital outflows the prc government may from time to time impose more restrictive foreign exchange policies and increase scrutiny of major outbound capital movements more restrictions and substantial vetting processes may be required by safe or other government authorities to regulate cross border transactions falling under the capital account the prc government may at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future if the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders including holders of our adss prc laws and regulations have more complex procedures for some acquisitions of chinese companies by foreign investors which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in china prc laws and regulations such as the regulations on mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors or the m amp a rules anti monopoly law of the prc and the rules of the prc ministry of commerce or the mofcom on implementation of the security review system of mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors or the mofcom security review rules established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities in china by foreign investors more time consuming and complex including requirements in some instances that the mofcom be notified in advance of any change of control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a prc domestic enterprise or that the approval from the mofcom be obtained in circumstances where offshore companies established or controlled by prc enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies prc laws and regulations also require certain merger and acquisition transactions to be subject to merger control review or security review table of contents according to these laws and regulations a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having 147 national defense and security 148 concerns and for mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire the 147 de facto control 148 of domestic enterprises that have 147 national security 148 concerns in addition when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a domestic enterprise by foreign investors is subject to the security review the mofcom will look into the substance and actual impact of the transaction the mofcom security review rules further prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies trusts indirect investments leases loans control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions we might grow our business in part by acquiring other companies operating in our industry complying with the requirements of the relevant regulations to complete such transactions could be time consuming and any required approval processes including approval from the mofcom may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share prc regulations relating to offshore investment activities by prc residents may limit our prc subsidiaries 146 ability to change their registered capital or distribute profits to us or otherwise expose us or our prc resident beneficial owners to liability and penalties under prc law safe promulgated the circular on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange administration on domestic resident 146 s investment and financing and roundtrip investment through special purpose vehicles or safe circular 37 in july 2014 that requires prc residents to register with safe or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing referred to as 147 offshore special purpose vehicle 148 in addition such prc residents must update their safe registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes any change of basic information including change of such prc residents name and operation term increases or decreases in investment amount transfers or exchanges of shares or mergers or divisions according to the notice on further simplifying and improving the foreign exchange administration policies on direct investment or safe notice 13 released on february 2015 by the safe local banks will examine and handle foreign exchange registration for overseas direct investment including the foreign exchange registration under safe circular 37 from june 2015 due to the inherent uncertainty in the implementation of regulatory requirements by the prc governmental authorities safe circular 37 registration might not be always practically available under all circumstances as prescribed in those regulations in addition we may not at all times be fully aware or informed of the identities of all the prc residents holding direct or indirect interest in our company we cannot assure you that all of our prc resident registered or beneficial owners are in compliance and will comply with safe regulations including those requiring them to make necessary applications filings and amendments to our knowledge certain of our prc resident individual shareholders who hold an insignificant number of our shares have not completed their safe circular 37 registration yet the failure or inability of our prc resident shareholders to comply with the safe registrations or failure by us to update the foreign exchange registrations of our prc subsidiaries may subject us to fines and legal sanctions such as restrictions on our cross border investment activities the ability of our wholly foreign owned subsidiaries in china to distribute dividends and proceeds from any reduction in capital share transfer or liquidation to us moreover failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liability under prc laws for circumventing applicable foreign exchange restrictions as a result our business operations and our ability to distribute profits to you could be materially and adversely affected failure to comply with prc regulations regarding the registration requirements for stock ownership plans or share option plans may subject the prc plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions in february 2012 safe promulgated the notices on issues concerning the foreign exchange administration for domestic individuals participating in stock incentive plans of overseas publicly listed table of contents companies or the stock option rules under the stock option rules and other relevant rules and regulations prc residents who participate in stock incentive plan in an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with safe or its local branches and complete certain other procedures participants of a stock incentive plan who are prc residents must retain a qualified prc agent which could be a prc subsidiary of such overseas publicly listed company or another qualified institution selected by such prc subsidiary to conduct the safe registration and other procedures with respect to the stock incentive plan on behalf of its participants such participants must also retain an overseas entrusted institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of stock options the purchase and sale of corresponding stocks or interests and fund transfers in addition the prc agent is required to amend the safe registration with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is any material change to the stock incentive plan the prc agent or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes certain of our directors executive officers employees and consultants who are prc residents may participate in our 2019 plan and therefore will be subject to these regulations upon the completion of this offering failure of these prc stock option holders to complete their safe registrations may subject these prc residents to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our prc subsidiaries limit our prc subsidiaries 146 ability to distribute dividends to us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business in addition the sat has issued certain circulars concerning employee share incentives under these circulars our employees working in the prc who exercise share options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to prc individual income tax our prc subsidiaries have obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options if our employees fail to pay or we fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and regulations we may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other prc government authorities our business and our profitability may be negatively affected by the rising labor costs and potential obligations to make additional contributions of social insurance premium and housing funds in recent years labor costs in china have continued to increase driven by increased inflation as well as enactment of new labor laws as a result we expect our labor costs including wages and employee benefits to continue to increase in the foreseeable future unless we are able to pass on these increased labor costs to our customers by increasing the prices of our products and services our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition we are required by prc laws and regulations to participate in various employee social security plans that are organized by municipal and provincial governments including housing pension medical insurance work related injury insurance employment injury insurance maternity insurance and unemployment insurance we are required under prc law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the salaries bonuses and certain allowances of our employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time the relevant government agencies may examine whether an employer has made adequate payments of these requisite statutory employee benefits and those employers who fail to make adequate payments may be subject to late payment fees fines and or other penalties we have historically failed to promptly make social insurance and housing fund contributions in full with respect to our employees if the relevant prc authorities determine that we shall make supplemental social insurance and housing fund contributions and that we are subject to fines and legal sanctions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected proceedings instituted by the sec against five china based accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act starting in 2011 five china based accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm were affected by a conflict between u s and chinese law specifically for certain u s listed companies table of contents operating and audited in china the sec and the pcaob sought to obtain from the chinese firms access to their audit work papers and related documents the firms were however advised and directed that under chinese law they could not respond directly to the u s regulators on those requests and that requests by foreign regulators for access to such papers in china had to be channeled through the csrc in december 2012 the sec instituted proceedings under rule 102 e 1 iii of its rules of practice and also under the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 against five china based accounting firms including our independent registered public accounting firm alleging that these firms had violated u s securities laws and the sec 146 s rules and regulations thereunder by failing to provide to the sec the firms 146 work papers related to their audits of certain china based companies that are publicly traded in the u s rule 102 e 1 iii grants the sec the authority to deny to any person temporarily or permanently the ability to practice before the sec who is found by the sec after notice and opportunity for a hearing to have willfully violated any such laws or rules and regulations on january 22 2014 an initial administrative law decision was issued censuring these accounting firms and suspending four of the five firms including our independent registered public accounting firm from practicing before the sec for a period of six months four of these china based accounting firms appealed to the sec against this decision and on february 6 2015 each of the four china based accounting firms agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the sec to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the sec the firms 146 ability to continue to serve all their respective customers is not affected by the settlement the settlement requires the firms to follow detailed procedures to seek to provide the sec with access to chinese firms 146 audit documents via the china securities regulatory commission or the csrc if the firms do not follow these procedures the sec could impose penalties such as suspensions or it could restart the administrative proceedings the settlement did not require the firms to admit to any violation of law and preserves the firms 146 legal defenses in the event the administrative proceeding is restarted if the sec restarts the administrative proceedings depending upon the final outcome listed companies in the united states with major prc operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the prc which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act including possible delisting moreover any negative news about any such future proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding china based u s listed companies and the market price of our ordinary shares may be adversely affected in december 2018 the sec and the pcaob issued a joint statement on regulatory access to audit and other information internationally that cites the ongoing challenges faced by them in overseeing the financial reporting of companies listed in the united states with operations in china the absence of satisfactory progress in discussions on these issues with chinese authorities and the potential for remedial action if significant information barriers persist as part of a continued regulatory focus in the united states on access to audit and other information currently protected by national law in particular china 146 s in june 2019 a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced bills in both houses of the u s congress that would require the sec to maintain a list of issuers for which the pcaob is not able to inspect or investigate an auditor report issued by a foreign public accounting firm the ensuring quality information and transparency for abroad based listings on our exchanges equitable act prescribes increased disclosure requirements for these issuers and beginning in 2025 the delisting from u s national securities exchanges such as nasdaq of issuers included on the sec 146 s list for three consecutive years enactment of this legislation or other efforts to increase u s regulatory access to audit information could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers including us and the market price of our adss could be adversely affected if our independent registered public accounting firm was denied even temporarily the ability to practice before the sec and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the exchange act such a determination could ultimately lead to the delisting of the adss table of contents from the nasdaq or deregistration from the sec or both which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of the adss in the united states the audit report included in this prospectus is prepared by auditors who are not inspected by the public company accounting oversight board and as such you are deprived of the benefits of such inspection our independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in our prospectus filed with the sec as auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the united states and a firm registered with the pcaob is required by the laws of the united states to undergo regular inspections by the pcaob to assess its compliance with the laws of the united states and professional standards because our auditors are located in the prc a jurisdiction where the pcaob is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the chinese authorities our auditors are not currently inspected by the pcaob on may 24 2013 pcaob announced that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding on enforcement cooperation with the csrc and the ministry of finance which establishes a cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations in the united states and china pcaob continues to be in discussions with the csrc and the ministry of finance to permit joint inspections in the prc of audit firms that are registered with the pcaob and audit chinese companies that trade on u s exchanges inspections of other firms that the pcaob has conducted outside china have identified deficiencies in those firms 146 audit procedures and quality control procedures which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality this lack of pcaob inspections in china prevents the pcaob from regularly evaluating our auditor 146 s audits and its quality control procedures as a result investors may be deprived of the benefits of pcaob inspections the inability of the pcaob to conduct inspections of auditors in china makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor 146 s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of china that are subject to pcaob inspections investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements risks relating to the adss and this offering an active trading market for our shares or the adss may not develop and the trading price for the adss may fluctuate significantly our adss have been approved for listing on the nasdaq global market we have no current intention to seek a listing for our class a ordinary shares on any other stock exchange prior to the completion of this offering there has been no public market for our adss or our class a ordinary shares and we cannot assure you that a liquid public market for our adss will develop if an active public market for our adss does not develop following the completion of this offering the market price and liquidity of our adss may be materially and adversely affected the initial public offering price for our adss has been determined by negotiation between us and the underwriters based upon several factors and we can provide no assurance that the trading price of our adss after this offering will not decline below the initial public offering price as a result investors in our securities may experience a significant decrease in the value of their adss the trading price of our adss may be volatile regardless of our operating performance the trading price of our adss could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control this may happen because of broad market and industry factors including the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with business operations located mainly in china that have listed their securities in the united states furthermore the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our adss regardless of our operating table of contents performance in addition to market and industry factors the price and trading volume for our adss may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations including the following variations in our revenues earnings and cash flow announcements of new investments acquisitions business partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors announcements of new test and service offerings solutions and expansions by us or our competitors failure on our part to realize monetization opportunities as expected changes in financial estimates by securities analysts detrimental adverse publicity about us our technology our tests or our industry additions or departures of key personnel release of lock up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional equity securities regulatory developments affecting us or our industry and potential litigation or regulatory investigations any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our adss will trade and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable in the past shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities if we were involved in a class action suit it could divert a significant amount of our management 146 s attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit which could harm our results of operations any such class action suit whether or not successful could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future in addition if a claim is successfully made against us we may be required to pay significant damages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our dual class share structure with different voting rights will limit your ability to influence our corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our class a ordinary shares and adss may view as beneficial immediately after the completion of this offering our ordinary shares will consist of 8 338 260 class a ordinary shares and 2 863 100 class b ordinary shares assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional adss and excluding shares issuable upon exercise of unexercised options or the warrants we have agreed to grant to the representatives of the underwriters or upon conversion by zhijun of its convertible loans to us in respect of matters requiring the votes of shareholders holders of class a ordinary shares will be entitled to one 1 vote per share while holders of class b ordinary shares will be entitled to ten 10 votes per share each class b ordinary share is convertible into one class a ordinary share at any time by its holder while class a ordinary shares are not convertible into class b ordinary shares under any circumstances upon any transfer of class b ordinary shares by a holder to any person or entity who is not an affiliate of the holder such class b ordinary shares will be automatically and immediately converted into the same number of class a ordinary shares we sell class a ordinary shares represented by our adss in this offering all of the outstanding ordinary shares held by dr chris chang yu through crs holdings inc and a portion of our ordinary shares held by zhangjiang gu ke company limited and zhijun sihang holdings limited respectively have been re designated as class b ordinary shares dr chris chang yu zhangjiang gu ke company limited and zhijun sihang holding limited beneficially own 63 5 12 3 and 8 7 respectively of the aggregate voting power of our company as of the date of this prospectus and will beneficially own approximately 61 3 11 8 and 8 3 respectively of the aggregate voting power of our company immediately table of contents after the completion of this offering due to the disparate voting powers associated with our dual class share structure assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional adss and excluding shares issuable upon exercise of unexercised options or the warrants we have agreed to grant to the representatives of the underwriters or upon conversion by zhijun of its convertible loans to us as a result of the dual class share structure and the concentration of ownership these holders of class b ordinary shares will have considerable influence over matters such as decisions regarding change of directors mergers change of control transactions and other significant corporate actions they may take actions that are not in the best interest of us or our other shareholders this concentration of ownership may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company which could have the effect of depriving our other shareholders of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and may reduce the price of our adss this concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any potential merger takeover or other change of control transactions that holders of class a ordinary shares and adss may view as beneficial after this offering share ownership will remain concentrated in the hands of our principal shareholders and management who will continue to be able to exercise a direct or indirect controlling influence on us we anticipate that our directors officers and current five percent or greater shareholders and affiliated entities will together beneficially own approximately 87 3 of the voting power of our ordinary shares issued and outstanding after this offering assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional adss and excluding shares issuable upon exercise of unexercised options or the warrants we have agreed to grant to the representatives of the underwriters or upon conversion by zhijun of its convertible loans to us as a result these shareholders acting together will have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our shareholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions corporate action might be taken even if other shareholders including those who purchase adss in this offering oppose them this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other shareholders may view as beneficial if securities or industry analysts do not publish research about our business or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our adss the market price for our adss and trading volume could decline the trading market for our adss will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our adss the market price for our adss would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our adss to decline substantial future sales or perceived potential sales of adss or ordinary shares including upon the exercise of vested options in the public market could cause the price of adss to decline sales of substantial amounts of our adss or ordinary shares including upon the exercise of vested options in our company in the public market after the completion of this offering or the perception that these sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our adss and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings in the future the adss sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act and shares held by our existing shareholders may also be sold in the public market in the future subject to the restrictions in rule 144 and rule 701 under the securities act and the applicable lock up agreements there will be 11 201 360 ordinary shares including 1 333 360 class a ordinary shares represented by adss outstanding immediately after this offering assuming the representatives of the underwriters do not exercise their over allotment option or the warrants we have agreed to grant to the representatives of the underwriters and excluding shares issuable upon the exercise of unexercised options or upon conversion by zhijun of its convertible loans to us in connection with this offering we our directors executive officers and our shareholders holding 1 or more of our ordinary shares outstanding prior to the table of contents effective date of this offering have agreed not to sell any ordinary shares or adss for 180 days after the date of this prospectus without the prior written consent of the underwriters subject to certain exceptions however at the request of the parties subject to the lock up restriction the representatives of the underwriters may exercise their discretion to release the lock up restriction prior to the expiration of the lock up period subject to applicable regulations of the financial industry regulatory authority inc also there may be perception that the parties subject to the lock up restriction will sell the shares after the lock up period sales of substantial amounts of adss in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our adss our memorandum and articles of association contain anti takeover provisions that could have a material adverse effect on the rights of holders of our ordinary shares and adss our memorandum and articles of association the 147 m amp a 148 contain provisions which may have the effect of limiting the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change of control transactions these provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction our dual class voting structure gives disproportionate voting power to the holders of our class a and class b ordinary shares our board of directors has the authority without further action by our shareholders to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations powers preferences privileges and relative participating optional or special rights and the qualifications limitations or restrictions including dividend rights voting rights terms of redemption and liquidation preferences any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our ordinary shares in the form of ads or otherwise preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult if our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares the price of our adss may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and adss may be materially and adversely affected as we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future after this offering you must rely on price appreciation of our adss for return on your investment we currently intend to retain most if not all of our available funds and any future earnings after this offering to fund the development and growth of our business as a result we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future therefore you should not rely on an investment in our adss as a source for any future dividend income accordingly the return on your investment in our adss will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our adss there is no guarantee that our adss will appreciate in value after this offering or even maintain the price at which you purchased the adss you may not realize a return on your investment in our adss and you may even lose your entire investment in our adss you may not receive dividends or other distributions on our class a ordinary shares and you may not receive any value for them if it is illegal or impractical to make them available to you the depositary of the adss has agreed that if it or the custodian receives any cash dividends or other distributions on class a ordinary shares or other deposited securities underlying the adss it will pay them to you after deducting its fees and expenses pursuant to the deposit agreement you will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of class a ordinary shares your adss represent however the depositary or the custodian is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of adss for example it would be unlawful to make a distribution to a holder of adss if it consists of securities that require registration under the securities act of 1933 but that are not properly registered or distributed under an applicable exemption from registration the depositary may also determine that it is not feasible to distribute certain property through the mail additionally the value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of mailing them in these cases the depositary may determine not to distribute such property we have no obligation to register under u s securities laws any adss class a ordinary shares rights or other table of contents securities received through such distributions we also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of adss class a ordinary shares rights or anything else to holders of adss this means that you may not receive distributions we make on our class a ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them available to you these restrictions may cause a material decline in the value of the adss the voting rights of holders of adss are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement and you may not be able to exercise your right to direct the voting of the underlying class a ordinary shares which are represented by your adss holders of adss do not have the same rights as our registered shareholders as a holder of our adss you will not have any direct right to attend general meetings of our shareholders or to cast any votes at such meetings you will only be able to exercise the voting rights which are carried by the underlying class a ordinary shares represented by your adss indirectly by giving voting instructions to the depositary in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement under the deposit agreement you may vote by giving voting instructions to the depositary if we instruct the depositary to ask for your instructions then upon receipt of your voting instructions the depositary will try as far as is practicable to vote the underlying class a ordinary shares represented by your adss in accordance with your instructions if we do not instruct the depositary to ask for your instructions the depositary may still vote in accordance with instructions you give but it is not required to do so you will not be able to directly exercise any right to vote with respect to the underlying class a ordinary shares represented by your adss unless you withdraw the shares and become the registered holder of such shares prior to the record date for the general meeting under our memorandum and articles of association the minimum notice period required to be given by our company to our registered shareholders to convene a general meeting will be seven days when a general meeting is convened you may not receive sufficient advance notice of the meeting to withdraw the shares underlying your adss and become the registered holder of such shares to allow you to attend the general meeting and to vote directly with respect to any specific matter or resolution to be considered and voted upon at the general meeting in addition under our amended and restated articles of association for the purposes of determining those shareholders who are entitled to attend and vote at any general meeting our directors may close our register of members and or fix in advance a record date for such meeting and such closure of our register of members or the setting of such a record date may prevent you from withdrawing the class a ordinary shares underlying your adss and becoming the registered holder of such shares prior to the record date so that you would not be able to attend the general meeting or to vote directly if we instruct the depositary to ask for your instructions the depositary will notify you of the upcoming vote and will arrange to deliver our voting materials to you we cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary how to vote the underlying class a ordinary shares represented by your adss in addition the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for their manner of carrying out your voting instructions this means that you may not be able to exercise your right to direct how the shares underlying your adss are voted and you may have no legal remedy if the shares underlying your adss are not voted as you requested you may experience dilution of your holdings due to the inability to participate in rights offerings we may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders including rights to acquire securities under the deposit agreement the depositary will not distribute rights to holders of adss unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities to which these rights relate are either exempt from registration under the securities act with respect to all holders of adss or are registered under the provisions of the securities act the depositary may but is not required to attempt to sell these undistributed rights to third parties and may allow the rights to lapse we may be unable to establish an exemption from registration under the securities act and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to these rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have a registration statement declared effective accordingly holders of adss may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a result table of contents you may be subject to limitations on transfer of your adss your adss are transferable on the books of the depositary however the depositary may close its books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties the depositary may close its books from time to time for a number of reasons including in connection with corporate events such as a rights offering during which time the depositary needs to maintain an exact number of ads holders on its books for a specified period the depositary may also close its books in emergencies and on weekends and public holidays the depositary may refuse to deliver transfer or register transfers of our adss generally when our share register or the books of the depositary are closed or at any time if we or the depositary thinks that it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or under any provision of the deposit agreement or for any other reason in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement as a result you may be unable to transfer your adss when you wish to your rights to pursue claims against the depositary as a holder of adss are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement the deposit agreement governing the adss representing our class a ordinary shares provides that subject to the depositary 146 s right to require a claim to be submitted to the u s federal or state courts in the city of new york have non exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine claims arising under the deposit agreement and in that regard to the fullest extent permitted by law ads holders waive the right to a jury trial of any claim they may have against us or the depositary arising out of or relating to our shares the adss or the deposit agreement including any claim under the u s federal securities laws if we or the depositary opposed a jury trial demand based on the waiver the court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable based on the facts and circumstances of that case in accordance with the applicable u s state and federal law to our knowledge the enforceability of a contractual pre dispute jury trial waiver in connection with claims arising under the u s federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the united states supreme court however we believe that a contractual pre dispute jury trial waiver provision is generally enforceable including under the laws of the state of new york which govern the deposit agreement in determining whether to enforce a contractual pre dispute jury trial waiver provision courts will generally consider whether a party knowingly intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to a jury trial we believe that this is the case with respect to the deposit agreement and the adss it is advisable that you consult legal counsel regarding the jury waiver provision before investing in the adss if you or any other holders or beneficial owners of adss bring a claim against us or the depositary in connection with matters arising under the deposit agreement or the adss including claims under u s federal securities laws you or such other holder or beneficial owner may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to such claims which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits against us and or the depositary if a lawsuit is brought against us and or the depositary under the deposit agreement it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable trial court which would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would have had including results that could be less favorable to the plaintiff s in any such action nevertheless if this jury trial waiver provision is not enforced to the extent a court action proceeds it would proceed under the terms of the deposit agreement with a jury trial no condition stipulation or provision of the deposit agreement or adss serves as a waiver by any holder or beneficial owner of adss or by us or the depositary of compliance with any substantive provision of the u s federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder we are subject to liability risks stemming from our foreign status which could make it more difficult for investors to sue or enforce judgments against our company we are a company incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands we conduct substantially all of our operations in china and substantially all of our assets are located in china in addition certain of our table of contents directors and executive officers reside within china for a significant portion of a year or are prc nationals and a substantial portion of their assets are within china as a result it could be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the united states in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the united states federal securities laws or otherwise even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind the laws of the british virgin islands and of china may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers for more information regarding the relevant laws of the british virgin islands and china see 147 enforceability of civil liabilities 148 in addition bvi companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the united states the circumstances in which any such action may be brought and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect to any such action may result in the rights of shareholders of a bvi company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the united states accordingly shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred for more information see 147 description of share capital 151 differences in corporate law 151 shareholders 146 suits 148 the bvi courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts in the united states based on certain liability provisions of u s securities law and to impose liabilities against us in original actions brought in the bvi based on certain liability provisions of u s securities laws that are penal in nature there is no statutory enforcement in the bvi of judgments obtained in the united states although the courts of the bvi will in certain circumstances recognize such a foreign judgment and treat it as a cause of action in itself which may be sued upon as a debt at common law so that no retrial of the issues would be necessary for more information see 147 enforceability of civil liabilities 148 this means that even if shareholders were to sue us successfully they may not be able to recover anything to make up for the losses suffered lastly under the provisions of the bvi act the memorandum and articles of association of a company are binding as between the company and its members and between the members in general members are bound by the decision of the majority or special majorities as set out in the articles of association or in the act as for voting the usual rule is that with respect to normal commercial matters members may act from self interest when exercising the right to vote attached to their shares if the majority members have infringed a minority member 146 s rights the minority may seek to enforce its rights either by derivative action or by personal action the bvi act provides that any member of a company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting from certain matters for more information see 147 description of share capital 151 differences in corporate law 151 shareholders 146 suits 148 generally any other claims against a company by its members must be based on the general laws of contract or tort applicable in the bvi or their individual rights as members as established by the company 146 s memorandum and articles of association which are more limited than the rights afforded investors under the laws of many states in the united states you may have difficulty enforcing judgment against us or our directors and officers we are a bvi holding company and most of our assets are located outside of the united states in addition certain of our directors and executive officers are residents of the prc and substantially all of their assets and our assets are located in the prc as a result you may not be able to effect service of process upon us or these directors and executive officers or to enforce against them judgments obtained in courts in the united states in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the u s federal securities laws or otherwise even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind the laws of the bvi and of china may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers table of contents you must rely on the judgment of our management as to the use of the proceeds from this offering and such use may not produce income or increase our ads price we have not determined a specific use for a portion of the net proceeds of this offering and our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the proceeds received by us you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether proceeds are being used appropriately the proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not improve our efforts to achieve or maintain profitability or increase our ads price the proceeds from this offering may be placed in investments that do not produce income or that lose value we will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company particularly after we cease to qualify as an 147 emerging growth company 148 we are now a public company and expect to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq impose various requirements on the corporate governance practices of public companies as a company with less than us 1 07 billion in revenues for our last fiscal year we qualify as an 147 emerging growth company 148 pursuant to the jobs act an emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies these provisions include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under section 404 in the assessment of the emerging growth company 146 s icfr the jobs act also permits an emerging growth company to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of such extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted for public companies we may take advantage of the aforesaid exemptions for so long as we remain an emerging growth company until the fifth anniversary from the date of our initial listing after we are no longer an 147 emerging growth company 148 we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of section 404 and the other rules and regulations of the sec for example as a result of becoming a public company we will need to increase the number of independent directors and adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures we also expect that operating as a public company will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage in addition we will incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements it may also be more difficult for us to find qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules and regulations and we cannot predict or estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs as we are a foreign private issuer and are exempt from certain nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to u s issuers you will have less protection than you would have if we were a domestic issuer the nasdaq listing rules require listed companies to have among other things a majority of their board members be independent as a foreign private issuer however we are permitted to and we will follow home country practice in lieu of the above requirements the corporate governance practice in our home country the bvi does not require a majority of our board to consist of independent directors since a majority of our board of directors will not consist of independent directors fewer board members may be exercising independent judgment and the level of board oversight on the management of our company may decrease as a result in addition the nasdaq listing rules also require u s domestic issuers to have a compensation committee a nominating corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors and an audit committee with a minimum of three members each of whom must be an independent director unless any exception under the nasdaq listing rules applies we as a foreign private issuer are not subject to these requirements except for table of contents the aforesaid independence requirement for audit committee members unless any exception under the nasdaq listing rules applies the nasdaq listing rules may require shareholder approval for certain corporate matters such as requiring that shareholders be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions to those plans certain ordinary share issuances we intend to comply with the requirements of the nasdaq listing rules in determining whether shareholder approval is required on such matters and to appoint a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee however we intend to follow home country practice to not have all members of our compensation committee and nomination and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors in addition we may consider following home country practice in lieu of the requirements under the nasdaq listing rules with respect to certain other corporate governance standards which may afford less protection to investors we are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the exchange act and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to united states domestic public companies because we are a foreign private issuer under the exchange act we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the united states that are applicable to u s domestic issuers including i the rules under the exchange act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on form 10 q or current reports on form 8 k with the sec ii the sections of the exchange act regulating the solicitation of proxies consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the exchange act iii the sections of the exchange act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time and iv the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under regulation fd we will be required to file an annual report on form 20 f within four months of the end of each fiscal year in addition we intend to publish our results on a quarterly basis through press releases distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of nasdaq stock market llc press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the sec on form 6 k however the information we are required to file with or furnish to the sec will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the sec by u s domestic issuers as a result you may not be afforded the same protections or information which would be made available to you were you investing in a u s domestic issuer there can be no assurance that we will not be a passive foreign investment company or pfic for u s federal income tax purposes for any taxable year which could subject u s holders of our class a ordinary shares or adss to adverse u s federal income tax consequences a non u s corporation will be a pfic if in any particular year either i 75 or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of 147 passive 148 income or ii the average percentage of the value of its assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income based on the average of four quarterly testing dates is at least 50 the 147 asset test 148 because the pfic tests must be applied each year and the composition of our income and assets and the value of our assets may change it is possible that we may be a pfic in the current or a future year in particular because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market price of our adss fluctuations in the market price of our adss may cause us to become a pfic the asset test is generally applied using the fair market values of a non u s corporation 146 s assets the asset test is applied using adjusted tax bases of the assets however if the non u s corporation is a controlled foreign corporation 147 cfc 148 and is not publicly traded for the year we are likely to be a cfc following the transition to a dual class structure and will become publicly traded as a result of the offering it is not entirely clear under current law how the asset test should be applied when a non u s corporation is either a cfc or is not publicly traded for only part of the year we believe however that it is reasonable for shareholders to apply the asset test using fair market values of our assets for each quarter that we either are not a cfc or are publicly traded although the internal revenue service 147 irs 148 could take a different position table of contents if we are a pfic in any taxable year a u s holder as defined in 147 taxation 151 united states federal income tax considerations 148 may incur significantly increased u s federal income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of our class a ordinary shares or adss and on the receipt of distributions on our class a ordinary shares or adss to the extent such gain or distribution is treated as an 147 excess distribution 148 under the u s federal income tax rules and such u s holder may be subject to burdensome reporting requirements further if we are a pfic for any year during which a u s holder holds our class a ordinary shares or adss we will generally continue to be treated as a pfic for all subsequent years during which such u s holder holds our class a ordinary shares or adss unless we cease to be a pfic and the u s holder makes a special 147 purging 148 election on irs form 8621 see 147 taxation 151 united states federal income tax considerations 151 passive foreign investment company status 148 for more

regulations of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to prc entities may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of the offering to make loans or additional capital

directors has discretion on whether to distribute dividends subject to certain restrictions under british virgin islands law namely that our company may only pay dividends if our directors are satisfied on reasonable grounds that we are solvent immediately after the dividend payment in the sense that we will be able to pay our debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business and the value of assets of our company will exceed our total liabilities even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends the form frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings capital requirements and surplus general financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant we have never declared or paid dividends and do not have any plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future and after this offering we intend to retain most if not all of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business we are a holding company incorporated in the british virgin islands we may rely on dividends from our subsidiaries in china for our cash requirements including any payment of dividends to our shareholders prc regulations may restrict the ability of our prc subsidiaries to pay dividends to us see 147 risk factors 151 risks relating to doing business in china 151 we rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our

to the depositary as the registered holder of such class a ordinary shares and the depositary then will pay such amounts to our ads holders in proportion to the class a ordinary shares underlying the adss held by such ads holders subject to the terms of the deposit agreement including the fees and expenses payable thereunder cash dividends on our class a ordinary shares if any will be paid in u s dollars table of contents capitalization the following table sets forth our capitalization as of september 30 2019 on an actual basis on a pro forma basis to reflect the re designation of 100 000 000 authorized ordinary shares to 70 000 000 class a ordinary shares and 30 000 000 class b ordinary shares pursuant to the resolutions of our board of directors and shareholders on october 29 2019 and on

september 30 2019 unaudited interim financial statements table of contents if you invest in our adss your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per ads and our net tangible book value per ads after this offering dilution results from the fact that the initial public offering price per ordinary share is substantially in excess of the book value per ordinary share attributable to the existing shareholders for our presently outstanding ordinary shares our net tangible book value as of september 30 2019 was approximately us 6 6 million or us 0 73 per ordinary share and us 0 73 per ads net tangible book value represents the amount of our total consolidated assets less the amount of our intangible assets goodwill and total consolidated liabilities dilution is determined by subtracting net tangible book value per ordinary share after giving effect to the additional proceeds we will receive from this offering from the initial public offering price of us 12 00 per ads and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us because the class a ordinary shares and class b ordinary shares have the same dividend and other rights except for voting and conversion rights the dilution is presented based on all issued and outstanding ordinary shares including class a ordinary shares and class b ordinary shares without taking into account any other changes in net tangible book value after september 30 2019 other than to give effect to our sale of the adss offered in this offering at the initial public offering price of us 12 00 per ads after deduction of the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us our pro forma net tangible book value as of september 30 2019 would have been us 5 6 million or us 0 54 per ordinary share and us 0 54 per ads this represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of us 1 27 per ordinary share and us 1 27 per ads to the existing shareholders and an immediate dilution in net tangible book value of us 11 46 per ordinary share and us 11 46 per ads to investors purchasing adss in this offering the following table illustrates such dilution per ordinary share initial public offering price net tangible book value as of september 30 2019 pro forma net tangible book value

not include ordinary shares underlying the adss issuable upon the exercise of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters ordinary shares purchased total consideration average price per ordinary share average price per ads existing shareholders 1 includes shares that were repurchased and cancelled prior to september 30 2019 and subsequently issued to the prc shareholders for no consideration which are contingently issuable shares and considered to be issued for accounting purposes in the september 30 2019 unaudited interim financial statements table of contents the discussion and tables above assume no exercise of any outstanding share options outstanding as of the date of this prospectus as of the date of this prospectus there are 1 163 500 ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding share options and there are 1 105 300 ordinary shares available for future issuance upon exercise of future grants under our 2019 share incentive plan to the extent that any of these options are exercised there will be further dilution to new investors table of contents enforceability of civil liabilities we were incorporated in the bvi in order to enjoy the following benefits political and economic stability an effective judicial system a favorable tax system the absence of exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services however certain disadvantages accompany incorporation in the british virgin islands these disadvantages include but are not limited to the the bvi has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and these securities laws provide significantly less protection to investors and bvi companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states our constitutional documents do not contain provisions requiring that disputes including those arising under the securities laws of the united states between us our officers directors and shareholders be arbitrated substantially all of our current operations are conducted in the prc and substantially all of our assets are located in the prc certain of our current directors and officers are nationals and residents of the prc and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the united states upon these persons or to bring an action against us or them in the united states or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in united states courts including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states we have appointed anpac us located at suite 127 2260 clove drive san jose ca 95128 as our agent to receive service of process with respect to any action brought against us in the courts of the state of delaware under the federal securities laws of the united states or under the securities laws of the state of delaware maples and calder hong kong llp our counsel as to bvi law have advised us that the courts of the bvi will not necessarily enter judgments in original actions brought in those courts predicated on u s federal or state securities laws additionally there is no statutory enforcement in the bvi of judgments obtained in the united states however the courts of the bvi will in certain circumstances recognize such a foreign judgment and treat it as a cause of action in itself which may be sued upon as a debt at common law so that no retrial of the issues would be necessary provided that the u s court issuing the judgment had jurisdiction in the matter and the company either submitted to such jurisdiction or was resident or carrying on business within such jurisdiction and was duly served with process the judgment given by the u s court was not in respect of penalties taxes fines or similar fiscal or revenue obligations of the company in obtaining judgment there was no fraud on the part of the person in whose favor judgment was given or on the part of the u s court recognition or enforcement of the judgment in the bvi would not be contrary to public policy and the proceedings pursuant to which judgment was obtained were not contrary to natural justice table of contents zhong lun law firm our counsel as to prc law have advised us that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of china would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states or entertain original actions brought in each respective jurisdiction against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states zhong lun law firm has advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the chinese civil procedure law chinese courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the chinese civil procedure law based either on treaties between china and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions china does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the bvi or the united states that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in addition according to the prc civil procedures law courts in the prc will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of prc law or national sovereignty security or public interest as a result it is uncertain whether a chinese court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in either of the bvi or the united states under the prc civil procedures law foreign shareholders may originate actions based on prc law against a company in china for disputes if they can establish sufficient nexus to the prc for a prc court to have jurisdiction and meet other procedural requirements including among others the plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case and there must be a concrete claim a factual basis and a cause for the suit it will be however difficult for u s shareholders to originate actions against us in the prc in accordance with prc laws because we are incorporated under the laws of the bvi and it will be difficult for u s shareholders by virtue only of holding the adss or our ordinary shares to establish a connection to the prc for a prc court to have jurisdiction as required under the prc civil procedures law table of

operating performance the presentation of this non gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u s gaap we define adjusted net loss as net loss adjusted to add back share based compensation expenses we believe that adjusted net loss helps to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that we add back to net loss we believe that adjusted net loss provides useful information about our operating results enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making the non gaap financial measure 147 adjusted net loss 148 is not defined under u s gaap is not presented in accordance with u s gaap and has limitations as an analytical tool one of the key limitations of using adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all of the items of income and expense that affect our operations share based compensation has been and may continue to be incurred in our business and is not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net loss further the non gaap financial measure 147 adjusted net loss 148 may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including peer companies and therefore their comparability may be limited we compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non gaap financial measure to the nearest u s gaap performance measure all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance this non gaap financial measure should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with u s gaap and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with u s gaap that are included elsewhere in this

condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties about our business and operations our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors including those we describe under 147 risk factors 148 and elsewhere in this prospectus see 147 special note regarding forward looking statements 148 overview we are a biotechnology company focusing on early cancer screening and detection we market and sell a multi cancer screening and detection test that uses our innovative patented cda technology and our proprietary cda device in addition to early cancer screening and detection our cda technology has demonstrated potential to assist physicians in cancer diagnosis prognosis and recurrence our cda technology provides a comprehensive platform on which we have developed our cda test and our proprietary cda device our cda test can detect and assess an individual 146 s overall cancer risk with high accuracy we also offer combination tests that combine our cda test with auxiliary tests based on other cancer screening and detection technologies such as biomarker based tests to detect the risk of specific cancer types our cda technology provides a highly accurate early stage risk assessment of the occurrence of cancer as of september 30 2019 our cda technology had been shown in numerous retrospective validation studies to be able to detect the risk of 26 cancer types with high sensitivity and specificity rates these 26 cancers accounted for over 80 of the cancer incidences in china from 2013 to 2018 according to frost amp sullivan our cda technology requires only a standard blood sample from a tested individual which minimizes the inconvenience and invasive procedures and avoids the harmful side effects that are inherent to many other technologies we have established a test database that as of september 30 2019 consisted of over 140 000 blood samples of various age sex and disease groups our database included approximately 100 000 samples from our commercial cda based tests and approximately 40 000 samples from our research studies according to frost amp sullivan we ranked first in china and second worldwide among companies offering next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in terms of the number of clinical samples for cancer screening and detection as of june 30 2019 for purposes of these rankings we had approximately 35 000 clinical samples as of june 30 2019 which represented the historical aggregate number of participants enrolled in our research studies that were developed in clinical sites qualified by competent authorities such as the nmpa in addition among companies offering next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in china in 2018 we ranked first in terms of volume of commercial cancer screening and detection tests conducted and fifth in terms of revenue from commercial cancer screening and detection tests according to frost amp sullivan we have established two clinical laboratories in china and one clinical laboratory in the united states our principal laboratory is a licensed biomedical clinical laboratory located in lishui zhejiang province china where we perform our commercial cda based tests including our cda tests and combination tests as well as a variety of other tests including immunological and biochemical tests our laboratory in haikou hainan province china is a licensed genomics clinical laboratory where we perform gene sequencing tests in addition to these two clinical laboratories we also have a research and development center located in shanghai china where we develop our next generation cancer screening and detection technology and tests in the united states we have a clinical laboratory located in san jose california for which we obtained a clia certificate of registration in march 2019 our san jose laboratory is equipped to perform our cda tests and biochemical tests we have entered into research agreements with u s universities and academic medical centers and we are in discussions with other u s hospitals medical institutions cros managed care companies and other health organizations to table of contents conduct research studies on our cda technology at this laboratory we also plan to open a second u s clinical laboratory in philadelphia pennsylvania in 2020 as of september 30 2019 we had filed 210 patent applications globally among them 121 patents had been granted including 55 in greater china including seven in taiwan and 16 in the united states and 89 patent applications were pending in china the united states and nearly 20 countries and regions our patent applications broadly cover apparatuses and methods for detecting diseases at early stages and they strategically encompass important specific embodiments of these apparatuses and methods our patent portfolio is one of the world 146 s largest in early cancer screening and detection using next generation technologies according to frost amp sullivan in 2015 we performed our first commercial cda based test in china since then we have generated revenue in china for four consecutive years the number of commercial cda based tests inclusive of cda tests and combination tests we sold increased significantly from 19 336 in 2017 to 41 607 in 2018 and from 29 036 in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to 41 544 in the same period of 2019 our revenue from sales of our cancer screening and detection tests predominantly cda based tests as well as genomics tests increased by 83 7 from rmb5 2 million in 2017 to rmb9 6 million us 1 3 million in 2018 and increased by 25 7 from rmb6 1 million in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to rmb7 7 million us 1 1 million in the same period of 2019 our total revenues increased by 80 3 from rmb5 7 million in 2017 to rmb10 3 million us 1 4 million in 2018 and increased by 22 3 from rmb6 6 million in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to rmb8 1 million us 1 1 million in the same period of 2019 in the united states we plan to commence marketing our cda test as an ldt sometime in 2020 at our clia registered laboratory in san jose key factors affecting our results of operations our business and operating results are influenced by certain general factors that affect china 146 s early cancer screening and detection market including the increasing prevalence of cancer in china growth of total healthcare expenditures and technological trends in cancer diagnosis treatment and management unfavorable changes in these general factors could adversely affect the results of our operations in addition to these general trends we believe that our results of operations are more directly affected by certain company specific factors including market adoption of our cda based tests we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our cda based tests in china we expect our business prospects to depend significantly on our ability to increase market adoption of our cda based tests in china as well as our ability to commercialize our cda based tests in the u s according to frost amp sullivan the market potential in china for early cancer screening and detection technologies increased at a cagr of 20 7 from us 27 7 billion in 2014 to us 58 8 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach us 115 1 billion in 2023 representing a cagr of 14 4 over this period china 146 s large aging population favorable government policies and relatively low labor costs represent substantial commercial opportunities for our business and enable us to cost effectively conduct our cancer screening and detection tests at a large scale however compared to conventional more widely accepted cancer screening and detection technologies we face additional challenges in raising recognition and adoption of our cda technology by physicians patients hospitals medical institutions healthcare payers and others in china 146 s medical community we believe that our cda technology addresses many limitations of current early cancer screening and detection methods such as its ability to detect the risk of multiple cancers early cost effectively and with high accuracy we have conducted numerous research studies in cooperation with hospitals and medical institutions in china to validate our cda technology and we have published the results of 15 completed research studies at the american society of clinical oncology or asco annual meetings and other medical conferences and medical table of contents journal supplements to increase market adoption of our cda based tests we intend to continue conducting research studies on our cda technology on more cancer types and its applications in additional oncological areas including assistance in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence and to present our study results at asco annual meetings and other medical conferences and publish them in important medical journals we are also seeking to cooperate with universities and academic medical centers hospitals and medical institutions cros managed care companies and other health organizations in the u s to conduct research studies on our cda technology with a view to commercializing our cda based tests in the u s market we plan to initially market our cda test as an ldt in the u s we expect to invest significantly in research studies regulatory approvals for our cda device by the nmpa we are currently licensed to manufacture our cda device and use it to perform our cda based tests at our own laboratories in china to enlarge our total addressable market in china in december 2018 we applied to the nmpa for a class iii medical device registration certificate for us to use our cda device to assist in multi cancer diagnosis after we obtain this license we will apply to update our medical device manufacture license to include the manufacture of class iii medical devices with these licenses we will be permitted to place our devices within chinese hospitals 146 laboratories to conduct commercial tests there or sell our devices to the hospitals for the purposes of assisting in physicians 146 diagnosis of specified multiple cancers we expect our revenues to grow substantially after our cda devices are approved to access the chinese hospital segment however it takes at least three years to obtain a class iii medical device registration certificate and the process is subject to regulatory and other uncertainties our customer base and customer mix our business growth depends significantly on our ability to maintain relationships with our existing customers and attract new customers our existing customers in china consist primarily of life insurance companies and other corporations which offer our cda based tests to their insured customers and or employees we also attract customers by offering our cda based tests as part of annual physical checkup packages and by engaging sales agents to market our tests we plan to broaden our cancer screening and detection test offerings including by expanding the range of genomics tests currently conducted at our haikou laboratory to attract more customers if we are able to obtain the class iii medical device registration certificate and update our medical device manufacture license for our cda device we will seek to access the chinese hospital market segment and provide our tests to more individual customers through chinese hospitals we expect our marketing expenses to continue to increase as we seek to increase market adoption of our technology and tests and build up our sales channels since our business scale is currently relatively small and our customers are largely corporates the availability and timing of large cda based test orders could cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly from period to period this makes it difficult to compare our historical operating results or predict our future performance cost structure our results of operations are significantly affected by our cost structure the largest component of our operating costs and expenses is staff costs primarily related to our management as well as research and development sales and marketing personnel we have also incurred significant share based compensation expenses to incentivize our directors officers employees and consultants which were rmb10 8 million rmb7 9 million us 1 1 million and rmb28 1 million us 3 9 million in 2017 2018 and the nine months ended september 30 2019 respectively in addition we have made substantial investments in customer acquisition research and development and patent applications to support our future growth and expansion as we begin to conduct research studies in the u s we expect our research and development expenses to significantly increase table of contents funding for our operations we have funded our operations primarily through capital contributions from our shareholders short term non bank borrowings and loans from related parties with the continuing expansion of our business we will require further funding possibly through public or private equity financings debt financings or other business arrangements the availability and costs of funding could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position furthermore debt financings could require us to agree to restrictive financial covenants which could make it more difficult for us to achieve our goals key operating data we regularly review a number of operating metrics including those set forth below to evaluate our business measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business the following table sets forth our key operating data for the periods indicated for the year ended december 31 for the nine months ended september 30 number of commercial cda based tests 1 completed number of cda based tests 1 for research purposes completed including our cda tests and combination tests key components of results of operations revenues we drive our revenues from two sources i revenue from sales of cancer screening and detection tests predominantly commercial cda based tests and ii net revenue from sales of physical checkup packages the table below presents our revenues by type in absolute amount and as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december 31 for the nine months ended september 30 in thousands except cancer screening and detection tests physical checkup packages total revenues cancer screening and detection tests our revenue from sales of cancer screening and detection tests consists predominantly of revenue from the sales of our commercial cda based tests we also generated an insignificant amount of revenue from our commercial genomics tests our commercial cda based tests comprise our cda tests and our combination tests which combine our cda test and on an auxiliary basis biomarker based cancer screening and detection tests performed either by us or by third party clinical laboratories we also recognize revenue from sales of commercial cda based tests that we provide as part of the physical checkup packages we sell we expect that table of contents our revenue generated from our commercial cda based tests will increase as our business grows including by providing additional tailored cda based tests to meet customer demand and exploring other sources of revenue related to our cda test we also expect to recognize additional revenue from commercial genomics tests as we devote more resources to marketing and sales of these tests physical checkup packages our net revenue from physical checkup packages represents our gross billing amount from physical checkup packages that we sell to our customers and have performed during a specified period less i the portion of fees for the commercial cda based tests contained in the packages which are recognized as part of our revenue from sales of cda based tests and ii our cost of physical checkup services other than cda based tests contained in the packages which are payments we make to third party physical checkup centers to which we outsource these services we believe that selling annual physical checkup packages can expand our customer base for commercial cda based tests and we intend to devote more resources to selling physical checkup packages and expect our net revenue from these packages to continue increasing cost of revenues our cost of revenues is related to our sales of cancer screening and detection tests predominantly our commercial cda based tests and to a lesser extent our genomics tests it mainly consists of staff costs outsourced testing costs blood sample taking costs medical consumable costs share based compensation and depreciation and amortization of our cda devices staff costs mainly include salaries and employee benefit expenses of personnel engaged in laboratory testing functions outsourced testing cost represents our cost of engaging third party clinical laboratories for their performance of auxiliary biomarker based cancer screening and detection tests which are included as part of our combination tests blood sample taking costs mainly include our cost of engaging third party nursing service providers who collect blood samples on our behalf for our commercial cda based tests we expect our cost of revenues to continue to grow as we increase the volume of our commercial cda based tests gross profit and gross margin our gross profit represents our revenue from sales of cancer screening and detection tests minus our cost of revenue plus our net revenues from sales of physical checkup packages our gross profit margin is affected primarily by the mix and relative prices of the cancer screening and detection tests that we sell within a specified period as well as changes in net revenues from sales of physical checkup packages as a percentage of our total revenues operating expenses our operating expenses include selling and marketing expenses research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a breakdown of these expenses for the periods indicated year ended december 31 for the nine months ended september 30 operating expenses selling and marketing expenses research and development expenses general and administrative expenses table of contents selling and marketing expenses our selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of staff costs for personnel engaged in sales marketing and customer support functions share based compensation marketing expenses travel expenses and office expenses we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase as we continue to build out our sales and marketing teams and engage more sales agents and other channel partners to increase our market penetration research and development expenses our research and development expenses primarily consist of staff costs for personnel engaged in research and development functions share based compensation travel expenses rental costs costs of consumables and accessories and depreciation and amortization mainly related to our clinical laboratory facilities and cda devices used for research and development purposes we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly in the near future because we not only have multiple on going research studies in china but have also entered into research agreements with u s universities and academic medical centers and we are in discussions with other u s hospitals medical institutions cros managed care companies and other health organizations to conduct research studies on our cda technology at our clia registered laboratory in san jose california general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses primarily include staff costs for personnel engaged in general and administrative functions share based compensation patent service fees professional service fees depreciation and amortization mainly related to our land use rights for the land we acquired in lishui zhejiang province and the office facilities on that land rental and property management fees and office expenses we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue increasing to support our business growth but we expect that they will eventually decrease as a percentage of our revenues once our business scale increases other income net our net other income primarily includes government grants we received including for 2018 the price that the government in lishui zhejiang province of china paid us for repurchase of a portion of a parcel of land that we did not utilize taxation bvi our company is incorporated in the bvi and we conduct our

to rmb8 1 million us 1 1 million for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb6 6 million for the same period of 2018 due to an increase in our revenue from sales of cancer screening and detection tests partially offset by a decrease in our net revenue from sales of physical checkup packages table of contents our revenue generated from sales of cancer screening and detection tests increased by 25 7 to rmb7 7 million us 1 1 million for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb6 1 million for the same period of 2018 due to an increase in the sales volume of our cda based tests which was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of our cda based tests as we offered greater discounts to certain customers as a marketing strategy our net revenue generated from sales of physical checkup packages decreased by 17 0 to rmb436 000 us 61 000 for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb525 000 for the same period of 2018 primarily due to a substantial increase in the volume of physical checkup packages that we sold to a sales agent at prices lower than our costs as part of our customer acquisition strategy cost of revenues our cost of revenues increased by 17 4 to rmb4 3 million us 597 000 for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb3 6 million for the same period of 2018 the increase was primarily attributable to our increased sales volume of cda based tests which resulted in an increase in the testing cost for outsourced biomarker based tests as well as increases in blood sample taking costs and medical consumables costs the increase in our cost of revenues was also attributable to an increase in depreciation expense as we put more cda devices into use to meet the increased demand for our cda based tests gross profit our gross profit increased by 28 4 to rmb3 8 million us 538 000 for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb3 0 million for the same period of 2018 our gross margin increased to 47 4 for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from 45 2 for the same period of 2018 primarily as a result of economies of scale operating expenses selling and marketing expenses our selling and marketing expenses increased by 49 0 to rmb10 7 million us 1 5 million for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb7 2 million for the same period of 2018 primarily due to i higher share based compensation as we granted more options to our marketing and sales personnel and ii higher marketing expenses as we increased our marketing efforts research and development expenses our research and development expenses decreased by 7 8 to rmb7 1 million us 1 0 million for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb7 7 million for the same period the year before primarily because we conducted less research and development activities under one of our research projects as we came closer to the completion of the project in the nine months ended september 30 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 the decrease in our research and development expenses was also attributable to a decrease in our research and development related traveling expenses these factors were partially offset by higher staff costs and share based compensation for our research and development personnel general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses increased significantly to rmb50 2 million us 7 0 million for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb18 8 million for the same period of 2018 primarily due to i higher professional service fees primarily related to this offering and ii higher share based compensation to personnel engaged in general and administrative table of contents interest expenses our interest expense increased significantly to rmb1 9 million us 265 000 for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb677 000 for the same period of 2018 primarily due to an increase in average borrowings other income net we recognized net other income of rmb484 000 for the nine months ended september 30 2018 which turned into net other loss of rmb1 1 million us 158 000 for the same period of 2019 primarily due to an increase in fair value loss as a result of the increase in value of the convertible loans that we borrowed from zhijun net loss as a result of the foregoing our loss for the year increased by 111 6 to rmb68 7 million us 9 6 million for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from rmb32 5 million for the same period the year before year ended december 31 2018 compared to year ended december 31 2017 revenues our revenues increased by 80 3 to rmb10 3 million us 1 4 million for 2018 from rmb5 7 million for 2017 primarily due to an increase in our revenue from sales of cancer screening and detection tests our revenue generated from sales of cancer screening and detection tests increased by 83 7 to rmb9 6 million us 1 3 million for 2018 from rmb5 2 million for 2017 primarily due to a substantial increase in the sales volume of our cda based tests offset in part by more favorable prices at which we offered our cda based tests to certain large customers in 2018 our net revenue generated from sales of physical checkup packages increased significantly to rmb693 000 us 97 000 for 2018 from rmb483 000 for 2017 primarily due to a significant increase in the volume of our physical checkup packages sold cost of revenues our cost of revenues increased by 43 4 to rmb5 7 million us 794 000 for 2018 from rmb4 0 million for 2017 the increase was primarily attributable to our increased sales volume of cda based tests which resulted in an increase in the testing cost for outsourced biomarker based tests as well as increases in blood sample taking costs and medical consumables costs the increase in our cost of revenues was also attributable to our share based compensation of rmb317 000 us 44 000 in 2018 while we did not recognize any share based compensation in 2017 gross profit our gross profit increased significantly to rmb4 6 million us 640 000 for 2018 from rmb1 7 million for 2017 our gross margin increased to 44 7 for 2018 from 30 5 for 2017 primarily because our revenue from sales of cancer screening and detection tests increased at a greater rate than our fixed costs such as staff costs as a result of economies of scale this increase in gross margin is also because our net revenue from sales of physical checkup packages increased as a percentage of our total revenues table of contents operating expenses selling and marketing expenses our selling and marketing expenses increased by 51 4 to rmb9 8 million us 1 4 million for 2018 from rmb6 5 million for 2017 primarily due to i higher marketing expenses as we increased our marketing efforts ii higher staff costs as we increased our marketing and sales headcount and iii higher share based compensation as we granted more options to our marketing and sales personnel research and development expenses our research and development expenses decreased by 11 4 to rmb10 1 million us 1 4 million for 2018 from rmb11 4 million for 2017 primarily because we granted fewer options to our research and development personnel these factors were partially offset by higher staff costs as we expanded our research and development team general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses increased by 15 7 to rmb28 8 million us 4 0 million for 2018 from rmb24 9 million for 2017 primarily due to higher professional service fees higher depreciation and amortization of property and equipment higher staff costs primarily due to an increase in headcount higher patent service expenses and higher rental costs these factors were partially offset by a decrease in our share based compensation as we granted fewer options to personnel engaged in general and administrative functions interest expenses our interest expense increased to rmb925 000 us 129 000 for 2018 from rmb338 000 for 2017 primarily due to an increase in average borrowings other income net our net other income increased significantly to rmb5 3 million us 735 000 for 2018 from rmb1 3 million for 2017 primarily due to the price that the government in lishui zhejiang province of china paid us in 2018 for repurchase of a portion of a parcel of land that we did not utilize net loss as a result of the foregoing our loss for the year increased by 7 6 to rmb42 3 million us 5 9 million for 2018 from rmb39 3 million for the prior year non gaap financial measure in evaluating our business we consider and use adjusted net loss a non gaap measure as a supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance the presentation of this non gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u s gaap we define adjusted net loss as net loss adjusted to add back share based compensation expenses we believe that adjusted net loss helps to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that we add back to net loss we believe that adjusted net loss provides useful information about our operating results enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making table of contents the non gaap financial measure 147 adjusted net loss 148 is not defined under u s gaap is not presented in accordance with u s gaap and has limitations as an analytical tool one of the key limitations of using adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all of the items of income and expense that affect our operations share based compensation has been and may continue to be incurred in our business and is not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net loss further the non gaap financial measure 147 adjusted net loss 148 may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including peer companies and therefore their comparability may be limited we compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non gaap financial measure to the nearest u s gaap performance measure all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance this non gaap financial measure should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with u s gaap and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with u s gaap that are included elsewhere in this prospectus the table below sets forth a reconciliation of our net loss to adjusted net loss for the periods indicated year ended december 31 nine months ended september 30 share based compensation expenses adjusted net loss liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been capital contributions from our shareholders short term non bank borrowings and loans and advances from our related parties as of september 30 2019 we had cash and cash equivalents of rmb24 0 million us 3 4 million consisting of cash on hand and demand deposits placed with banks as of september 30 2019 we had an advance of rmb25 0 million us 3 5 million that jiaxing zhijun sihang investment partnership enterprises limited partnership or zhijun sihang provided to one of our prc subsidiaries in 2018 zhijun sihang is in the process of making equity contribution of these funds in our company as of september 30 2019 our short term debt included i convertible loans of rmb21 7 million us 3 0 million that we borrowed from zhijun in 2018 which have been extended to april 30 2020 and ii a short term non bank borrowing of rmb8 0 million us 1 1 million the maturity of which has been extended to june 12 2020 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand anticipated equity contributions of our shareholders borrowings our anticipated cash flows generated from our operating activities and financial support from our founder and chairman dr chris chang yu will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes for at least the next 12 months after this offering we may decide to expand our business through additional equity and debt financing the issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in utilizing the proceeds we expect to receive from this offering we may make additional capital contributions or loans to our prc subsidiaries however most of these uses are subject to prc regulations substantially all of our revenues in the foreseeable future are likely to continue to be in the form of renminbi under existing prc foreign exchange regulations payments of current account items including profit distributions interest payments and trade and service related foreign exchange transactions can table of contents foreign currencies without prior safe approval as long as certain routine procedural requirements are fulfilled therefore our prc subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends in u s dollars to us without prior safe approval by following these routine procedural requirements however approval from or registration with competent government authorities is required where the renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of china to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies the prc government may at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future the following table sets forth

million us 325 000 increase in accounts payable these factors were partially offset by an rmb5 4 million us 750 000 increase in accounts receivable as we sold a relatively large amount of cda tests on credit in the third quarter of 2019 an rmb3 2 million us 444 000 increase in other current assets and an rmb1 6 million us 224 000 decrease in advances from customers primarily related to our cda based tests net cash used in operating activities for 2018 was rmb31 1 million us 4 4 million which was primarily attributable to our net loss of rmb42 3 million us 5 9 million for the same period as

us 1 1 million and depreciation and amortization of rmb3 1 million us 440 000 before changes in operating assets and liabilities our increase in net operating liabilities of rmb874 000 us 121 000 was primarily due to an rmb2 3 million us 326 000 increase in advances from customers primarily related to our cda based tests and an rmb1 4 million us 195 000 increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities these factors were partially offset by an rmb1 6 million us 230 000 increase in advances to suppliers and an rmb1 1 million us 153 000 increase in accounts receivable net cash used

reporting personnel and other resources to address our internal controls and procedures in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2018 and the review of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of september 30 2019 and for the nine months ended september 30 2018 and 2019 we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified two material weaknesses in our icfr as defined in the standards established by the public company accounting oversight board of the united states a 147 material weakness 148 is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in icfr such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company 146 s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weaknesses identified are our company 146 s lack of sufficient accounting and financial reporting personnel with requisite knowledge and experience in application of u s gaap and sec rules and our lack of financial reporting policies and procedures that are commensurate with u s gaap and sec reporting requirements we are in the process of implementing a number of measures to address these material weaknesses identified including i hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel with u s gaap and sec reporting experience ii obtaining advisory services from professional consultants with experience in the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and internal audit guidance on sec reporting iii expanding the capabilities of our existing accounting and financial reporting personnel through continuous training and education in the accounting and reporting requirements under u s gaap and sec rules and regulations iv developing communicating and implementing an accounting policy manual for our accounting and financial reporting personnel for our recurring transactions and period end closing processes and v establishing effective monitoring and oversight controls for non recurring and complex transactions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our company 146 s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures the process of designing and implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that is adequate to satisfy our reporting

adopted by the sec we as a public company after being listed are required to maintain adequate icfr and include our management 146 s assessment of the effectiveness of our company 146 s icfr in our annual report inflation since our inception inflation has not materially affected our results of operations according to the national bureau of statistics of china the year over year percent change in the consumer price index was 1 8 for december 2017 1 9 for december 2018 and 3 0 for september 2019 although we have not been materially affected by inflation we may be affected if china experiences higher rates of inflation in the future qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk concentration of credit risk financial instruments may subject us to significant concentration of credit risk these financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables as of december 31 2017 and 2018 and september 30 2019 the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents of rmb8 9 million rmb7 0 million us 982 000 and rmb9 4 million us 1 3 million respectively was held at major financial institutions located in the prc and rmb2 5 million rmb5 9 million us 821 000 and rmb14 6 million us 2 0 million respectively was deposited with major financial institutions located outside the prc our management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality and continually monitors the credit worthiness of these financial institutions historically deposits in chinese banks are secure due to the state policy on protecting depositors 146 interests however china promulgated a new bankruptcy law in august 2006 that came into effect on june 1 2007 which contains a separate article expressly stating that the state council may promulgate implementation measures for the bankruptcy of chinese banks based on the bankruptcy law under the new bankruptcy law a chinese bank may go into bankruptcy in addition since china 146 s concession to the world trade organization foreign banks have been gradually permitted to operate in china and have been significant competitors against chinese banks in many aspects especially since the opening of the renminbi business to foreign banks in late 2006 therefore the risk of bankruptcy of those chinese banks in which we have deposits has increased in the event of bankruptcy of one of the banks which holds our deposits we are unlikely to claim our deposits back in full since the bank is unlikely to be classified as a secured creditor based on prc laws accounts receivables unsecured and denominated in renminbi derived from sales on our cancer screening and detection tests and physical checkup packages are exposed to credit risk as of december 31 2017 and 2018 and september 30 2019 we had three customers one customer and three customers respectively each with a receivable balance exceeding 10 of the total accounts receivable balance the risk is mitigated by credit evaluations that we perform on our corporate customers currency convertibility risk a significant portion of our expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in renminbi on january 1 1994 the prc government abolished the dual rate system and introduced a single rate of exchange as quoted daily by the people 146 s bank of china the 147 pboc 148 however the unification of the exchange rates does not table of contents imply that the renminbi may be readily convertible into u s dollar or other foreign currencies all foreign exchange transactions continue to take place either through the pboc or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the pboc approvals of foreign currency payments by the pboc or other institutions require submitting a payment application form together with relevant documents additionally the value of the renminbi is subject to changes in central government policies and international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the prc foreign exchange trading system market foreign currency exchange rate risk since july 21 2005 renminbi has been permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies the u s dollar depreciated against renminbi by approximately 6 3 in 2017 and appreciated against renminbi by approximately 5 7 in 2018 as the trade war between the u s and china escalated the u s dollar has appreciated against renminbi to be 1 6 9161 as of january 24 2020 it is difficult to predict how market forces or prc or u s government policy may impact the exchange rate between the renminbi and the u s dollar the functional currency of our company and anpac us is the u s dollar and the functional currency of our prc subsidiaries and our reporting currency is renminbi most of our revenues and costs are denominated in rmb while a portion of cash and cash equivalents and convertible loans are denominated in u s dollars it is difficult to predict how market forces or the prc or u s government policy may impact the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us in the future any significant fluctuation of the valuation of rmb may materially affect our cash flows revenues earnings and financial position and the value of any dividends payable on the ads in us liquidity risks as of september 30 2019 we had

were available to be issued in the event of any unexpected adverse change in our business we have the ability and intent to obtain additional equity or debt financing and we have received financial support from our founder and chairman dr chris chang yu critical accounting polices judgments and estimates an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u s gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u s gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates actual results could differ from those estimates and as such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements table of contents the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other disclosures included in this prospectus when reviewing our financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgments and other uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions revenue recognition effective from january 1 2017 we early adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance or implementation guidance issued between august 2015 and december 2016 within asu 2015 14 asu 2016 08 asu 2016 10 asu 2016 12 and asu 2016 20 collectively 147 asc 606 148 we derive our revenues principally from customers through our cancer screening and detection tests and physical checkup services revenue is recognized when we satisfy the performance obligations in an amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services we evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the services provided to customers and are the principal namely on a gross basis or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the customers and are the agent namely on a net basis we present value added taxes as a reduction from revenues revenue from cancer screening and detection tests our revenue from cancer screening and detection tests is primarily generated through the sales of the our proprietary cda tests and our combination tests which combines our cda test and on an auxiliary basis tests based on other cancer screening and detection technologies such as biomarker based tests to our customers including corporations and life insurance companies a contract exists when the master service agreement has been executed and the customer submits a service request which is a placed order our contracts have a single performance obligation which is satisfied upon provision of the cda based test s and delivery of the cda based test result to the customer we act as the principal as we control the cda based test s before it is transferred to the customer and record revenue on a gross basis at the point in time when the cda based test s result is delivered to the customer in particular we record revenue generated from our combination tests on a gross basis including the portion of revenue which we subsequently pay to third parties as consideration for their performance of outsourced auxiliary biomarker based tests revenue from physical checkup packages we facilitate corporations and life insurance companies to procure physical checkup services from third party physical checkup service providers for their respective employees and policy holders we enter into contracts with corporations and life insurance companies and physical checkup service providers we consider both the corporations and life insurance companies and the third party physical checkup service providers as our customers in this type of transaction our performance obligation is to facilitate the corporations and life insurance companies and the third party physical checkup service providers to complete the purchase of physical checkup services which is not controlled by us before the services are transferred to the corporations and life insurance companies therefore we fulfill our performance obligation at the point in time when the employees of corporations and policy holders of life insurance companies complete the physical checkups and we record the net amount that we retain from these completed transactions as revenue we also enter into arrangements to deliver both cda based tests and physical checkup services we are the principal for the cda based tests and the agent for the physical checkup services revenues for both services are recognized at the point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied upon delivery of the cda based test results to the end customers and completion of the physical checkup services respectively as we act as both the principal and agent in the arrangement we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand alone selling price basis table

and consultant 146 s salaries benefits share based compensation and related costs raw materials and supplies for internally developed product candidates and external costs of outside vendors engaged to conduct clinical development activities and trials we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc 718 compensation stock compensation 147 asc 718 148 in accordance with asc 718 we determine whether an award should be classified and accounted for as a liability award or an equity award all of our share based awards were classified as equity awards and were recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values in accordance with asc

compensation cost is recognized if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and shall not be recognized if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved we have elected to recognize share based compensation using the straight line method for all share based awards granted with graded vesting based on service conditions we use the accelerated method for all awards granted with graded vesting based on performance conditions we account for forfeitures as they occur in accordance with asu no 2016 09 compensation stock compensation topic 718 improvement to employee share based payment accounting with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm we determined the fair value of the stock options granted to employees fair value of options

accounting policies 148 of our consolidated financial statements table of contents all information and data presented in this section have been derived from an industry report commissioned by us and prepared by frost amp sullivan or the frost amp sullivan report unless otherwise noted frost amp sullivan has advised us that the statistical and graphical information contained herein is drawn from its database and other sources the following discussion includes projections for future growth which may not occur at the rates that are projected or at all overview cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity around the world there were approximately 18 0 million new cases of cancer worldwide in 2018 and this number is projected to be 20 4 million in 2023 at the same time china 146 s population is aging rapidly the number of people in china over 65 grew at a cagr of 4 9 from 137 6 million in 2014 to 166 6 million in 2018 and it is expected to grow at a cagr of 5 2 from 2018 to reach 215 1 million in 2023 this demographic shift offers immense opportunities for china 146 s cancer screening and detection market as elderly people generally have a greater risk of suffering from cancers early cancer screening and detection saves lives and reduces costs because early cancer screening and detection potentially shifts cancer diagnosis and treatment to earlier stages of the disease it can improve patients 146 treatment outcomes cancer researchers frequently refer to the five year relative survival rate which is the probability of being alive five years after cancer diagnosis compared with the experience of the general population the five year relative survival rate of patients at the advanced stages of a cancer namely stage iii and stage iv generally declines significantly compared with those diagnosed at the early stages namely stage zero stage i and stage ii for esophageal colorectal cervical and breast cancers the five year relative survival rates at the early stages are over 80 emphasizing the importance of early cancer screening and detection driven by the increasing effectiveness of oncology drugs especially emerging targeted therapies the total direct medical cost for cancers including expenditures for treatment as well as the cost of care and rehabilitation related to the illness in china is estimated to increase at a cagr of 13 1 from rmb411 5 billion in 2018 to rmb761 5 billion in 2023 typically the cost of treating cancer is lower when the disease is caught at an earlier stage this is because if a cancer patient can be diagnosed earlier that patient may be able to rely on surgical resection rather than drug therapies or use standard frontline drugs rather than aggressive experimental regimens these early stage treatment regimens typically significantly reduce the patient 146 s lifetime direct medical cost for cancers for example the estimated lifetime cost of treatment for a cancer diagnosed at an advanced stage is roughly twice that of a cancer diagnosed at an early stage table of contents options for early cancer screening and detection overview because of its advantages early cancer screening and detection represents huge market potential in both china and the united states however early cancer screening and detection remains one of the most challenging tasks in the medical field due to the difficulties in finding cancers early accurately and cost effectively cancer screening is the use of a test among individuals with a population risk for or higher probability of cancer to detect the cancer sooner or prevent its complications major options for early cancer screening and detection currently include the following tumor markers the two principal methods for tumor marker detection are immunoassays and molecular testing immunoassays immunoassays are tests that detect the presence of a specific antibody or antigen in the body tumor markers used in immunoassays are proteins or other biomarkers produced by malignant cells and or other cells of an organism in response to the onset of cancer because tumor markers can be observed in cancer free subjects immunoassays that are designed to detect tumor markers need to be used in combination with other tests to confirm cancer diagnoses immunoassays for tumor marker detection can be used for various purposes including screening for cancer assistance in cancer diagnosis staging of disease monitoring the effectiveness of therapy or prognosis providing evidence of cancer recurrence only a few tumor markers are useful for screening while most can be used for prognosis or to provide evidence of cancer recurrence common tumor markers used in immunoassays include prostate specific antigen or psa for prostate cancer cancer antigen 125 or ca 125 for ovarian cancer and alpha fetoprotein or afp for hepatocellular carcinoma currently there is no clinically validated tumor marker for esophageal cancer or brain cancer molecular testing molecular testing analyzes biological markers associated with cancers in the genome two novel techniques of molecular testing are ct dna test which detects circulating tumor dna in the bloodstream and ctc test which detects cells in the bloodstream that have been shed from primary tumors neither of these techniques has been used in routine clinical practice ctc tests can be used in the management of cancer by isolating tumor cells which allows for morphologic identification and molecular characterization while ct dna tests are currently limited to mutation detection imaging screening for cancer using radiographic imaging such as mammograms x rays and ct scans has been available for decades and numerous clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in specific instances breast cancer and lung cancer are the two cancers that benefit the most from early cancer screening and detection using imaging biophysical property based technologies biophysical property based technologies such as our cda technology focus on biophysical properties that exist in human blood and that regulate cell surface differentiations and intercellular communications these biophysical properties can signal risks of pre cancer states and cancers and they change over time as cancer occurs progresses or regresses according to frost amp sullivan we are one of the first biotechnology companies worldwide to focus on the detection and measurement of cancers 146 biophysical properties endoscopic exams endoscopy has a major role in the detection and characterization of neoplastic lesions along the digestive tract in all screening strategies typical endoscopic exams include cystoscopy colonoscopy endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ercp esophagogastroduodenoscopy or egd and sigmoidoscopy among others table of contents in addition to the classifications of cancer screening and detection technologies above our cda technology as well as ctcs ct dnas exosome mrnas and other emerging technologies are also classified as 147 next generation 148 cancer screening and detection technologies in our industry and related research fields limitations of current options for early cancer screening and detection currently available early cancer screening and detection options have significant weaknesses that hinder their use including imperfect sensitivity and specificity for early stage cancer screening and detection there are currently no sufficiently sensitive tests to detect most cancers in their early stages for example there are no clinically validated tumor markers for esophageal or brain cancer and the current tumor marker test for liver cancer afp has low sensitivity when detecting liver cancer in early stages current screening options may also lead to high false positive rates for example over the course of ten years of annual mammography more than 50 of women in the u s would experience a false positive mammogram false positives can result in unnecessary interventions increased costs and psychological burdens invasiveness and side effects many established tests such as colonoscopies and pap smears are invasive these tests can also result in negative health impacts such as the risk of perforation with colonoscopies and the radiation exposure risk with mammograms multiple screening modalities required across cancer types currently there are often multiple detection options for a single type of cancer multiple screening modalities are generally required for detection of multiple cancer types and the complex screening regimens required are difficult for both patients and providers to sustain equipment for current screening options usually require significant capital expenditures making screening difficult in resource limited geographies hospitals and clinics must purchase expensive equipment such as ct scanners mammogram machines and gene sequencing machines to perform many common cancer screening and detection tests many early cancer screening and detection tests particularly ct dna and ctc based tests are therefore quite expensive market opportunity while early detection of cancers greatly improves clinical outcomes by providing clinical care and medical intervention at early stages china 146 s early cancer screening and detection industry is still at the starting stage based on china 146 s large population the market potential in china for early cancer screening and detection technologies increased at a cagr of 20 7 from us 27 7 billion in 2014 to us 58 8 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach us 115 1 billion in 2023 representing a cagr of 14 4 over this period according to frost amp sullivan the percentage of people that conducted physical checkups in china in 2018 was estimated to be 31 2 far below that of 77 0 in the u s for the same year we believe that our cda technology can address many of the limitations of current early cancer screening and detection methods and that we are well positioned to benefit from the expected rapid growth in china 146 s early cancer screening and detection market we believe that the advantages of our cda technology summarized below can help us seize the tremendous market opportunity numerous research studies have demonstrated our cda technology 146 s ability to detect early stage cancers with high sensitivity and specificity rates including those cancers generally considered difficult for liquid based technologies to test with high accuracy such as lung and esophageal cancers our cda technology is liquid based and our tests require only a standard blood sample from a tested individual which minimizes the invasive procedure required making our tests side effect free retrospective validation studies have shown that our cda technology combined with our cda device can detect the risk of up to 26 types of cancer using a single blood test table of contents we developed our cda technology and our patented cda device entirely in house our cda device is much less costly to manufacture than gene sequencing machines used by ct dna based technologies and micro electrical mechanical devices used by ctc based technologies the lower cost of our device substantially reduces our capital expenditure investment and operational costs compared to these other technologies as a result our cda tests are much less expensive than a typical ct dna or ctc based test early cancer screening and detection market in china and the united states china in china early cancer screening and detection technologies are typically used in four segments of the market hospitals physical checkup centers independent clinical laboratories and non medical entities such as general commercial enterprises and insurance companies hospitals are the traditional segment of china 146 s early cancer screening and detection market and are still the market 146 s largest segment however to access the chinese hospital segment service providers must obtain the medical device registration certificates issued by the nmpa which form a high barrier to entry physical checkup centers are a less regulated market segment and these centers are supplemental to hospitals in offering cancer screening and detection services to the public early cancer screening and detection service providers face intensified competition in this segment resulting in low bargaining power for them independent clinical laboratories also provide cancer screening and detection services to customers however unlike physical checkup centers which typically provide immunoassay based tests independent clinical laboratories typically offer their customers more advanced technologies such as ct dna and ctc based technologies these laboratories are under strict supervision of the nhc and may require certificates such as certificates for the compliance with the iso standards and those issued by china national accreditation service for conformity assessment or cnas to conduct their business as a result their laboratories typically place high demands on early cancer screening and detection service providers that they cooperate with which moderates competition in this market segment certain non medical entities such as general commercial enterprises and insurance companies constitute a rapidly developing market segment with high growth potential as they seek to provide cancer screening services to their employees or insured individuals these entities may cooperate with early cancer screening and detection companies directly in developing related services however because this market segment is relatively disperse cancer screening and detection service providers must spend more on marketing efforts to address this market segment the united states in the united states the market for early cancer screening and detection technologies primarily includes four segments healthcare service providers insurance companies retail and enterprises healthcare service providers include hospitals and independent physicians and clinics they constitute a highly regulated market segment like their counterparts in china there are many commercial insurance companies in the united states that purchase early cancer screening and detection services resulting in a large market segment for these companies cost price is often their principal criterion when selecting early cancer screening and detection services which forms a barrier to entry into this market individual consumers can also order cancer screening and detection kits directly from the relevant service providers 146 websites this retail model provides the most convenient way for many consumers to take cancer screening and detection tests table of contents similar to the situation in china general commercial enterprises are also a rapidly developing market segment in the united states the geographic dispersion of these purchasers requires companies attempting to serve them to expend substantial marketing efforts competitive landscape according to frost amp sullivan we ranked first in china and second worldwide among companies offering next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in terms of the number of clinical samples for cancer screening and detection as of june 30 2019 for purposes of these rankings we had approximately 35 000 clinical samples as at june 30 2019 which represented the historical aggregate of participants enrolled in our research studies that were developed in clinical sites qualified by competent authorities such as the nmpa in addition among companies offering next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in china in 2018 we ranked first in terms of the volume of commercial cancer screening and detection tests provided and fifth in terms of revenue from commercial cancer screening and detection tests we also ranked fourth among companies that provide next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in terms of the number of patents for inventions related to early cancer screening and detection issued in greater china and fifth in the u s both as of june 30 2019 table of contents overview we are a biotechnology company focusing on early cancer screening and detection we market and sell a multi cancer screening and detection test that uses our innovative patented cda technology and our proprietary cda device in addition to early cancer screening and detection our cda technology has demonstrated potential to assist physicians in cancer diagnosis prognosis and recurrence our cda technology provides a comprehensive platform on which we have developed our cda test and our proprietary cda device our cda test can detect and assess an individual 146 s overall cancer risk with high accuracy including early stage cancer we also offer combination tests that combine our cda test with auxiliary tests based on other cancer screening and detection technologies such as biomarker based tests to detect the risk of specific cancer types when we refer to our technology or tests as a 147 cancer screening and detection 148 technology or test in this prospectus we refer to the detection and assessment of the risk of cancer occurrence not to cancer diagnosis our cda technology focuses on biophysical properties in human blood recent studies have shown that there is a correlation between certain biophysical properties including acoustical electrical magnetic nano mechanical and optical properties and cancer occurrence these studies have revealed that biophysical properties could be important non genetic aspects of the micro environment regulating the balance between normal cell growth and carcinogenesis cancerous growth which may lead to cancer occurrence biophysical properties 146 physical expressions of information in the blood can indicate risks of pre cancerous states and cancers these biophysical signals change over time as cancer occurs progresses or regresses our proprietary cda device uses an integrated sensor system to detect certain biophysical signals in blood samples after collecting data on these signals we use our cda technology and proprietary algorithm to measure and analyze these signals at multiple biological levels including the protein cellular and molecular levels and with multiple parameters including the overall cda value the ptf value and the ctf value according to frost amp sullivan we are one of the first biotechnology companies worldwide to focus on the detection and measurement of cancers 146 biophysical properties in our industry and related research fields our cda technology as well as ctcs ct dnas exosome mrnas and other emerging technologies are known as 147 next generation 148 cancer screening and detection technologies our cda technology provides a highly accurate early stage risk assessment of the occurrence of cancer as of september 30 2019 our cda technology had been shown in numerous retrospective validation studies to be able to detect the risk of 26 cancer types with high sensitivity and specificity rates these 26 cancers accounted for over 80 of the cancer incidences in china from 2013 to 2018 according to frost amp sullivan our cda technology requires only a standard blood sample from a tested individual which minimizes the inconvenience and invasive procedures and avoids the harmful side effects that are inherent to many other technologies we have established a test database that as of september 30 2019 consisted of over 140 000 blood samples of various age sex and disease groups our database included approximately 100 000 samples from our commercial cda based tests and approximately 40 000 samples from our research studies according to frost amp sullivan we ranked first in china and second worldwide among companies offering next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in terms of the number of clinical samples for cancer screening and detection as of june 30 2019 for purposes of these rankings we had approximately 35 000 clinical samples as of june 30 2019 which represented the historical aggregate number of participants enrolled in our research studies that were developed in clinical sites qualified by competent authorities such as the nmpa in addition among companies offering next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in china in 2018 we ranked first in terms of volume of commercial cancer screening and detection tests conducted and fifth in terms of revenue from commercial cancer screening and detection tests according to frost amp sullivan we have established two clinical laboratories in china and one clinical laboratory in the united states our principal laboratory is a licensed biomedical clinical laboratory located in lishui zhejiang province china table of contents where we perform our commercial cda based tests including our cda tests and combination tests as well as a variety of other tests including immunological and biochemical tests our laboratory in haikou hainan province china is a licensed genomics clinical laboratory where we perform gene sequencing tests in addition to these two clinical laboratories we also have a research and development center located in shanghai china where we develop our next generation cancer screening and detection technology and tests in the united states we have a clinical laboratory located in san jose california for which we obtained a clia certificate of registration in march 2019 our san jose laboratory is equipped to perform our cda tests and biochemical tests we have entered into research agreements with u s universities and academic medical centers and we are in discussions with other u s hospitals medical institutions cros managed care companies and other health organizations to conduct research studies on our cda technology at this laboratory we also plan to open a second u s clinical laboratory in philadelphia pennsylvania in 2020 as of september 30 2019 we had filed 210 patent applications globally among these 121 patents had been granted including 55 in greater china including seven in taiwan and 16 in the united states and 89 patent applications were pending in china the united states and nearly 20 other countries and regions our patent applications broadly cover apparatus and methods for early stage disease detection and they strategically encompass important specific embodiments of these apparatus and methods our patent portfolio is one of the world 146 s largest for early cancer screening and detection using next generation technologies according to frost amp sullivan we performed our first commercial cda based test in china in 2015 since then we have generated revenue in china for four consecutive years the number of commercial cda based tests inclusive of cda tests and combination tests we sold increased significantly from 19 336 in 2017 to 41 607 in 2018 and from 29 036 in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to 41 544 in the same period of 2019 our revenue from sales of cancer screening and detection tests predominantly cda based tests as well as genomics tests increased by 83 7 from rmb5 2 million in 2017 to rmb9 6 million us 1 3 million in 2018 and increased by 25 7 from rmb6 1 million in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to rmb7 7 million us 1 1 million in the same period of 2019 our total revenues increased by 80 3 from rmb5 7 million in 2017 to rmb10 3 million us 1 4 million in 2018 and increased by 22 3 from rmb6 6 million in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to rmb8 1 million us 1 2 million in the same period of 2019 in the united states we currently plan to commence marketing our cda test as an ldt sometime in 2020 through our clia registered laboratory in san jose our competitive strengths novel patented early multi cancer screening and detection technology our cda technology is a liquid based technology it focuses on biophysical properties in human blood recent studies have shown that there is a correlation between certain biophysical properties including acoustical electrical magnetic nano mechanical and optical properties and cancer occurrence these studies have revealed that biophysical properties could be important non genetic aspects of the micro environment regulating the balance between normal cell growth and carcinogenesis cancerous growth which may lead to cancer occurrence biophysical properties 146 physical expressions of information in the blood can indicate risks of pre cancerous states and cancers and they change over time as cancer occurs progresses or regresses our proprietary cda device uses an integrated sensor system to detect certain biophysical signals in blood samples after collecting data on these signals we use our cda technology and proprietary algorithm to measure and analyze these signals at multiple biological levels including the protein cellular and molecular levels and with multiple parameters including the overall cda value the ptf value and the ctf value in contrast many other liquid based cancer screening and detection technologies focus on biochemical signals such as conventional biomarkers genomic signals such as ct dnas and ctcs these other liquid based technologies typically can only determine whether or not cancer has occurred at a static point in time in addition conventional biomarkers have relatively low sensitivity and specificity rates and they are prone to be triggered by non cancerous diseases table of contents some cancer types such as esophageal cancer and brain cancer do not have corresponding biomarkers on the other hand ct dnas and ctcs are only detectable after a tumor has formed and as such their physical expressions of information or signals are typically weak during the early stages of a cancer as their concentrations in the blood are relatively low moreover ct dna and ctc based technologies typically require complex and expensive gene sequencing machines and micro electrical mechanical devices respectively to amplify relatively weak signals for cancer screening and detection purposes we believe that our cda technology has the following advantages compared to other cancer screening and detection technologies ability to detect the risk of cancer with high accuracy the accuracy of cancer screening and detection technologies can be measured by two key performance metrics 151 sensitivity and specificity sensitivity indicates the ability of a test to correctly identify those who have cancer among the population with cancer whereas specificity indicates the ability of the test to correctly identify those who do not have cancer among the population without cancer these two metrics are critical for effective treatment selection based on the results of liquid based testing numerous retrospective validation studies have shown that our cda technology can successfully detect the risk of cancers with high sensitivity and specificity rates for example as of september 30 2019 in completed research studies our cda technology had successfully detected the risk of i lung cancer in 2 277 cases with the meta analysis sensitivity of 82 4 and specificity of 83 0 and ii esophageal cancer in 2 253 cases with the meta analysis sensitivity of 85 8 and specificity of 93 0 according to frost amp sullivan these high sensitivity and specificity rates are generally considered difficult for liquid based cancer screening and detection technologies to achieve for lung and esophageal cancers and they represent a leading position in terms of testing accuracy in the early cancer screening and detection industry ability to detect the risk of multiple cancers using one blood test our retrospective validation studies have shown that our cda technology combined with our cda device can detect the risk of 26 types of cancers in a single blood test these 26 cancers accounted for over 80 of the cancer incidences in china from 2013 to 2018 according to frost amp sullivan while our cda test alone does not indicate precisely which specific type s of cancer an individual may have if it indicates a medium or high risk of cancer the tested individual can use concurrent combinations of tests or follow up screening tests performed by us or at hospitals or physical checkup centers to determine the specific cancer type s that may exist or the location s of the cancer s for example we offer our cancer positioning services using a combination of our cda technology and on an auxiliary basis biomarkers to indicate the risk of specific cancer type s in one blood test this advantage of our cda technology as well as our cda test 146 s ability to work in combination with other auxiliary tests using our proprietary algorithm enable us to maintain a comprehensive and flexible test menu to meet different customers 146 needs proprietary technology supporting low priced testing we developed our patented cda technology and our proprietary cda device entirely in house our cda device is less costly to manufacture than the equipment used by many of our competitors such as gene sequencing machines used by ct dna based technologies and micro electrical mechanical devices used by ctc based technologies in addition we conduct cancer risk assessments using our proprietary algorithm furthermore we do not rely on third party licenses of intellectual property in developing our cda technology and cda device these advantages reduce our operating costs enabling us to offer our cda tests at prices significantly lower than many of our competitors such as typical ct dna and ctc based tests minimally invasive side effect free and automated compared to conventional approaches to cancer screening and detection such as imaging technology and tissue biopsy our cda technology is liquid based and requires only a standard blood sample from a tested individual this minimizes the invasiveness of our tests and means they do not result in harmful side effects in addition our cda device is highly automated requiring minimal human involvement potential for assistance in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence our cda technology can be used to track variations in cancer related biophysical properties as a disease progresses regresses or recurs table of contents our cda technology can assist physicians in their cancer diagnosis by providing input complementary to pathologic information drawn from a tissue biopsy which helps oncologists ensure that their cancer diagnoses are comprehensive and unbiased given these qualities in addition to early cancer screening and detection our cda technology has demonstrated potential for assisting in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence expansive patent portfolio and proprietary test database according to frost amp sullivan we are one of the first biotechnology companies worldwide focusing on the detection and measurement of cancers 146 biophysical properties we have an expansive patent portfolio based on our technological innovations and substantial research studies which is one of the world 146 s largest in early cancer screening and detection using next generation technologies according to frost amp sullivan as of september 30 2019 we had filed 210 patent applications globally among them 121 patents had been granted including 16 in the united states and 55 in greater china including seven in taiwan and 89 patent applications were pending in china the united states and nearly 20 countries and regions including populous countries such as india and brazil our patent applications broadly cover apparatus and methods for detecting diseases at early stages and they strategically encompass important specific embodiments of these apparatus and methods we believe that our expansive patent portfolio helps us to maintain and strengthen our technological advantages and market position it also allows us to develop our patented cda technology entirely in house 151 without reliance on licenses of third party technologies because we do not have to pay technology license fees or purchase expensive testing equipment the cost of our cda test is significantly lower than that of many of our competitors this cost advantage expands the total addressable market of our cda test we have also established a test database that as of september 30 2019 consisted of over 140 000 blood samples of various age sex and disease groups this database included approximately 100 000 samples from our commercial cda based tests and approximately 40 000 samples from our research studies according to frost amp sullivan based on approximately 35 000 clinical samples we ranked first in china and second worldwide among companies offering next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in terms of the number of clinical samples for cancer screening and detection as of june 30 2019 and we ranked first in terms of the number of commercial cancer screening and detection tests conducted in 2018 among companies that offer next generation early cancer screening and detection technologies in china our test database helps us to continuously refine our algorithm and provide high accuracy tests substantially all of the blood samples in our database were collected and tested in china we have cooperated with a number of chinese hospitals and medical institutions to conduct retrospective validation studies on our cda technology for single or multiple cancers leveraging our relationships with these research partners we anticipate having a relatively stable supply of blood samples to support our future research and further expand our test database in china in addition we have entered into research agreements with u s universities and academic medical centers and we are in discussions with other u s hospitals medical institutions cros managed care companies and other health organizations to conduct research studies on our cda technology at this laboratory fully commercialized operations in china 151 rolling out our china experience to the u s china 146 s large aging population favorable government policies and relatively low labor costs represent substantial commercial opportunities for our business that enable us to cost effectively conduct our cancer screening and detection tests at a large scale as a result while many of our competitors that operate only in the united states are still working to make their first breakthrough in product development we have commercialized our cda based tests in china and generated revenue for four consecutive years since selling our first commercial cda based test in 2015 the number of commercial cda based tests inclusive of cda tests and combination tests we sold increased significantly from 19 336 in 2017 to 41 607 in 2018 and from 29 036 in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to 41 544 in the same period of 2019 our revenue from our cancer screening and detection tests predominantly cda based tests as well as genomics tests increased by 83 7 from rmb5 2 million in 2017 to rmb9 6 million us 1 3 million in 2018 and increased by 25 7 from table of contents rmb6 1 million in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to rmb7 7 million us 1 1 million in the same period of 2019 with several years of operations our china based team has accumulated valuable know how with respect to the research and development and commercialization of our cda technology and tests we believe that this experience and know how will be of significant value in implementing our plans to develop our business in the u s through research studies and the commercialization of our cda tests an experienced management team with proven track records of success we have an experienced management team with multi disciplinary backgrounds and expertise who have demonstrated the ability to develop and commercialize innovative technologies and products this strong team has paved the way for us to develop our cda technology for early cancer screening and detection dr chris chang yu our co founder and chairman has over 20 years 146 experience in the semiconductor integrated circuit materials life sciences and environmental protection industries he is the first or principal inventor of over 300 patent applications among which over 100 are related to cancer diagnostics his knowledge in weak signal detection semiconductor manufacturing and life

development mr weidong dai our china president has rich cross disciplinary experience covering medical sciences and enterprise management he has served as an adjunct professor at anhui college of traditional chinese medicine since 2004 and an executive director at the hainan branch of china science tsing research institute of science and technology since 2018 our strategies our objective is to become the leading provider of highly accurate and cost effective cancer screening and detection tests and to expand the application of our tests to other oncological areas such as assistance in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence to achieve this we intend to enlarge our total addressable market in china by obtaining additional regulatory approvals for our cda device we intend to enlarge our total addressable market in china by obtaining additional regulatory approvals for our cda device we obtained a class ii medical device manufacture license from the nmpa in 2013 renewed table of contents in 2018 and a class ii medical device registration certificate from the nmpa in 2015 these licenses allow us to manufacture our cda device and use it to perform our cda based tests in our own laboratories in china in december 2018 we applied to the nmpa for a class iii medical device registration certificate for our cda device to assist in multi cancer diagnosis after we obtain this license we will apply to update our medical device manufacture license to include the manufacture of class iii medical devices with these class iii medical device licenses we will be able to place our devices within chinese hospitals 146 laboratories to conduct commercial tests there or sell our devices to the hospitals for the purposes of assisting in physicians 146 diagnoses of specified multiple cancers grow our customer base in china our existing customer base in china consists primarily of life insurance companies and other large corporations we offer our cda based tests to their insurance customers and or employees we plan to acquire customers for our cda based tests through the annual physical checkup packages we offer we largely outsource these physical checkups other than cda based tests to third party physical checkup centers in addition we plan to further develop our non cda cancer screening and detection tests using other technologies including expanding the genomics tests we currently conduct at our haikou laboratory after obtaining the class iii medical device registration certificate and updating our medical device manufacture license we expect to provide our tests to more individual customers through chinese hospitals we will also seek to increase our market penetration by continuing to build out our sales and marketing teams and engaging more sales agents and other channel partners strengthen technological advantages with focused research and development according to frost amp sullivan we are one of the first biotechnology companies worldwide focusing on the detection and measurement of cancers 146 biophysical properties we plan to strengthen our technological advantages through focused research and development in particular we plan to continuously make game changing innovations by leveraging our management 146 s multi disciplinary backgrounds and expertise we have been collaborating with a number of hospitals and medical institutions in conducting research studies our collaborations allow us to validate the effectiveness and utility of our cda tests in a clinical setting explore new applications of our cda technology and provide us access to clinically well characterized patient data in the future our research and development will continue to focus on exploring our cda technology 146 s ability to dynamically monitor cancer progression particularly for assistance in cancer diagnosis prognosis and recurrence and to improve our cda technology 146 s ability to identify cancer types our cda technology 146 s signal to noise

expanding our cda technology 146 s application to additional oncological areas bring our tests to the u s market in the united states we are currently permitted to conduct our cda based tests for research use we have entered into research agreements with u s universities and academic medical centers and we are in discussions with other u s hospitals medical institutions cros managed care companies and other health organizations to conduct research studies on our cda technology in the u s we intend to commercialize our cda based tests for clinical purposes in the united states initially as an ldt performed at our laboratory in san jose california as an ldt under the fda 146 s current enforcement discretion policy we do not expect that our cda based test will require premarket clearance market authorization or approval from the fda prior to marketing table of contents we have received a clia certificate of registration for our san jose laboratory we may begin marketing our tests for clinical purposes as soon as we complete our validation studies and obtain any required state laboratory licenses or other required accreditations under clia cap and state licensing requirements we are required to validate our cda test with applicable analytical and clinical studies prior to marketing the test as an ldt these studies are designed to demonstrate the performance of the test we have entered into research agreements with u s universities and academic medical centers and we are in discussions with other health organizations to conduct these studies our cda technology our cda technology provides an innovative and comprehensive platform for us to develop multi cancer screening and detection tests with high sensitivity specificity and cost efficiency principal mechanism focus on biophysical properties our cda technology is a liquid based technology the critical difference between our cda technology and other liquid based cancer screening and detection technologies is that our technology focuses on biophysical properties rather than conventional biochemical or genomic properties specifically our cda technology is based on the correlations between biophysical properties and cancer occurrence recent studies have shown that there is a correlation between certain biophysical properties and cancer occurrence these studies have revealed that certain biophysical properties could be important non genetic aspects of the micro environment regulating the balance between normal cell growth and carcinogenesis cancerous growth which may lead to cancer occurrence biophysical properties exist in all human beings including healthy individuals and the signals they express can be detected before a tumor has formed biophysical properties increase or decrease progressively in a statistically significant way from healthy state to non cancerous disease pre cancer disease early and late stage cancer states the change in biophysical properties is a potential cause for the loss of immunity and increased occurrence of cancer on the other hand the strength of biophysical signals expressed by these biophysical properties 151 which our cda technology is designed to detect 151 increase progressively from healthy through late stage cancer states we have collected testing data on 26 types of cancer including data on biophysical properties measured in multiple serial samples collected from the same person over time and corresponding pathological data our proprietary algorithm is based on this database and it uses the testing data collected by our cda device to determine the ptf value ctf value and overall cda value of a blood sample the overall cda value determined through our test factors in the ptf and ctf value as well as other biophysical property characteristics of the blood sample the overall cda value as the principal parameter for our cda technology is proportional to the cancer risk based on the progressive changes of biophysical properties and their signals from healthy through late stage cancer states we believe that our cda technology is ideally suited for early cancer screening and detection as well as assistance in cancer diagnosis prognosis and reoccurrence through tracking cda values we can obtain both static and dynamic progression of information on cancer risk multi level and multi parameter our cda technology is designed to analyze biophysical properties that potentially influence body functions at multiple biological levels including cellular protein and molecular levels by comparison some other liquid based cancer screening and detection technologies are based on detection signals that exist at only one of the cellular protein and molecular levels 151 for example conventional biomarkers at the protein level and ctcs at the cellular level as a result of this multi level analysis we believe that our cda technology is more comprehensive and that it can provide more dimensions of information potentially making it more accurate in detecting cancers table of contents our cda technology quantitatively measures biophysical properties that are collectively possessed by a biological specimen these properties may vary by health status at the cellular protein and molecular levels at the cellular level biophysical properties may not only change with a cell 146 s surface properties but they may also alter when interactions occur between cells for example intercellular repulsions and attractions as well as possibly cell to cell signaling at the protein and molecular levels certain biophysical properties may modify proteins 146 surface phases and structures and affect the molecular mechanism that maintains the nuclear and genomic integrity of normal cells shifts and aberrations in these biophysical properties may potentially lead to alterations in cell interactions and possibly affect functioning and replication of dna these shifts and aberrations could therefore cause increased mistakes in gene replications and even increased frequency of gene mutations that result in various diseases including cancer in addition different cancers may share certain common biophysical properties and our cda technology captures and quantifies the biophysical signals of malignant cells that are in general distinct from those in normal cells as a result of these measurements our cda technology can detect the risk of multiple cancers in one test in contrast certain other liquid based cancer signals only exist at one of the above three levels cellular protein or molecular and normally a specific signal corresponds to only one cancer for instance afp tumor marker a protein biomarker is typically used to screen exclusively for liver cancer and psa another protein biomarker is typically only used to detect prostate cancer our cda technology together with our cda device deploys various measurement parameters primarily ptf ctf and cda values by detecting certain biophysical properties in blood after testing a blood sample our cda device generates a series of testing data including the ptf value the ctf value and the overall cda value the ptf value refers to the measured level of protein cancer related factor in the blood the ctf value refers to the measured level of cellular cancer related factors in the blood using our proprietary algorithm we arrive at the overall cda value based on the ptf and ctf values as well as other biophysical property characteristics of the blood this overall cda value is the principal analysis parameter that we use to assess an individual 146 s overall cancer risk based on the results of these parameters we assess the risk of cancer to be low normal medium or high analytical validation we have conducted numerous research studies on our cda technology 146 s utility and accuracy since 2015 we have completed 25 research studies on our cda technology with hospitals and medical institutes in china among them the results of 15 research studies on which we collaborated with five chinese hospitals and medical institutes have been published at asco annual meetings and other medical conferences and in medical journal supplements we have also completed an additional ten unpublished research studies with nine hospitals and medical institutes in china since 2015 we have tested more than 140 000 blood samples collected from various age sex and disease groups including approximately 100 000 samples from our commercial cda based tests and approximately 40 000 samples from our research studies table of contents our research studies have demonstrated that our cda technology can detect the risk of multiple cancers with high sensitivity and specificity rates we have used meta analysis to analyze the resulting data of all completed research studies for a specific cancer type up to september 30 2019 and calculated our cda technology 146 s sensitivity and specificity rates for that cancer type meta analysis is a statistical analysis of a large collection of analysis results from individual studies for the purpose of integrating the findings the

means that none of our completed research studies of that cancer type had been published up to september 30 2019 early cancer screening and detection research studies a number of our research partners including hospitals and medical institutions in china have validated our cda technology 146 s ability to detect the risk of multiple cancers this validation has been done through their un blinding of our single or double blinded testing results for tested individuals in their institutions single blinded test refers to the testing process in which we do not know but our research partners know about the pathological or clinical information of the tested samples or the makeup of the patient and control groups during the course of testing by comparison in double blinded tests neither us nor our research partners have this information until the un blinding step un blinding refers to the disclosure of the previously withheld information to us by our research partners in single blinded tests or the publication of this information by a third party study administrator or by our research partners after they otherwise acquire the information set forth below are several representative examples of validation studies on our cda technology that we have completed with chinese hospitals shanghai changhai hospital since 2015 we have cooperated with shanghai changhai hospital to research various cancers including lung cancer we have published six papers under this project the latest paper was published at the 2019 asco annual meeting in this study 832 blood samples collected from patients with non small cell lung cancer or nsclc and 642 blood samples from healthy individuals as the control group were tested using our cda technology the results indicated that our cda technology had good sensitivity and specificity rates even for lung cancer at stage i 151 85 2 and 93 0 respectively table of contents a cancer hospital in beijing this hospital is one of the first hospitals that has cooperated with us in conducting research studies at the 2015 asco annual meeting we published a paper evaluating our multi level multi parameter cda detection method for digestive system cancer diagnosis based on one of our joint research studies with this hospital although the sample size was limited this was the earliest paper comparing our cda technology with conventional biomarkers in this study the hospital collected blood samples from nine hcc patients and six colorectal cancer patients as well as from a control group of 20 healthy individuals these blood samples were tested by both our cda technology and methods based on conventional biomarkers including afp and carcinoembryonic antigen or cea the results showed that there was a significant statistical difference in the measured overall cda value between each of the hcc and colorectal cancer patient groups and the control group specifically in the hcc group our cda technology had a sensitivity rate of 77 0 compared to the afp based method 146 s 33 0 while the specificity rates of both methods were similar in the colorectal cancer group our cda technology had a sensitivity rate of 83 0 compared to the cea based method 146 s 33 0 while the specificity rates of both methods were similar lishui central hospital the fifth affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university we have collaborated with lishui central hospital the fifth affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university or lishui central hospital primarily in liver and lung cancer studies we published two papers one on hcc and one on nsclc at the 2015 asco annual meeting in the hcc study blood samples were collected from 485 hcc patients 64 cirrhosis patients and 44 patients with benign liver diseases or bld as well as from a control group of 75 healthy individuals all the samples were tested using our cda technology the results indicated that there was a significant statistical difference in the measured overall cda value between the hcc patient group and each of the control bld and cirrhosis groups in the nsclc study three groups of blood samples were tested using our cda technology which included 383 samples collected from nsclc patients 103 samples from patients with non cancerous lung diseases and a control group of  healthy individuals the results indicated that our cda technology can detect nsclc with the sensitivity of 87 7 and specificity of 79 9 follow up phone consultations we conduct follow up phone consultations with individuals for whom we have conducted commercial cda based tests to validate our cda technology 146 s utility in detecting the risk of cancer these individuals were generally asymptomatic at the time they took our tests we began our first follow up call in 2017 and plan to do these follow up phone consultations for five years we have obtained preliminary results from this initiative we typically call a tested individual for the first time within 15 days for individuals with high risk results three months for those with medium risk results or six months for those with low risk results after issuing a cancer risk assessment report for a tested individual we also have subsequent phone consultations with the tested individuals on an annual basis during these consultations our customer support and service personnel typically ask the tested individuals with medium or high risks of cancer about among other things their health conditions whether or not they have taken follow up checkup tests as we suggested in the cancer risk assessment reports and the relevant follow up diagnoses or test results if any as of october 25 2019 we had contacted over 12 000 tested individuals of whom 6 401 individuals gave us substantive feedback regarding their health conditions and disease development and among them 479 were previously tested as having high risk of cancer 5 452 with medium risk of cancer and the rest with low risk of cancer based on the feedback from these calls table of contents 889 of the tested individuals had been diagnosed with various major diseases or cancers by third party hospitals and medical institutions within two years of taking our cda based tests including 135 cases with cancers 393 with pre cancer diseases or benign tumors and 361 with major non cancerous diseases all of these 889 individuals were previously tested as having medium or high risk of cancer and none were previously tested as having low risk of cancer among those 479 and 5 452 individuals tested with high and medium risk of cancer respectively 172 or 35 9 and 717 or 13 2 had been diagnosed with cancers pre cancer diseases or major non cancerous diseases respectively as it may take years for diseases to progress into cancers or pre cancer or major non cancerous diseases we expect that the percentage of cancer occurrence among these 6 401 cases will likely increase over time assistance in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence assistance in diagnosis oncologists typically use tissue biopsy as the 147 gold standard 148 method for cancer diagnosis and they also utilize multiple technologies to provide multi dimensional input to a cancer diagnosis these technologies can be used for 147 assistance in diagnosis 148 because they provide input complementary to pathologic information drawn from a tissue biopsy which helps physicians to ensure that their cancer diagnoses are comprehensive and unbiased for example a ct scan in conjunction with the detection of cea and other tumor markers is often used to assist in diagnosing lung cancer since 2015 we have collaborated with third party oncologists and hospitals in utilizing our cda technology to assist in the diagnosis of multiple cancer types in a number of research studies these research studies are designed to evaluate the performance of our cda technology in predicting cancer occurrence in a population with cancer symptoms or abnormal test results to date ten of these studies have been published at asco annual meetings and other medical conferences and medical journal supplements the results of these studies demonstrated our cda technology 146 s effectiveness in assisting in the diagnosis of multiple cancers 151 particularly lung and esophageal cancers for example in our joint study on nsclc with shanghai changhai hospital in 2017 2017 asco annual meeting j clin oncol 35 e23131 2017 our cda technology successfully detected nsclc with sensitivity of 68 7 higher than those of ct scans for all nsclc stage groups this indicates that compared to a ct scan our cda test provides more accurate and reliable diagnostic information and data for oncologists in diagnosing lung cancer in another study with shanghai changhai hospital in 2015 2015 asco annual meeting j clin oncol 33 e15059 2015 our cda technology detected esophageal cancer with relatively high sensitivity of 70 0 and specificity of 90 0 these results indicated our cda technology 146 s effectiveness in assisting in the diagnosis of esophageal cancer prognosis and recurrence prognosis refers to an assessment of whether and how a patient responds to cancer treatment effective prognostic tools can help oncologists dynamically monitor cancer treatment progression make necessary and timely adjustments to cancer treatment and correctly predict a patient 146 s treatment outcome such as the survival rate 151 the percentage of people in a patient group who will be alive for a period of time the survival time 151 life expectancy after diagnosis and whether or not they will go into remission in some circumstances prognosis can be effective even before the cancer treatment starts recurrence means return of cancer after the patient has been treated and has gone into remission and happens more frequently for certain cancer types patients who have gone into remission have a substantially higher risk of cancer recurrence than the general population it is therefore important to have technologies to detect cancer recurrence timely cost effectively and without side effects because biophysical properties in the blood increase or decrease progressively in a statistically significant way from healthy state to late stage cancer states we believe that our cda technology can be used for prognosis of cancer treatment outcomes and for detecting the risk of cancer recurrence table of contents in a study published at the 2016 asco annual meeting 2016 asco annual meeting j clin oncol 34 2016 suppl abstr e23176 we investigated our cda technology 146 s potential for breast cancer prognosis by testing the blood samples collected from three breast cancer patients the cda data for each patient 146 s blood samples were grouped into three categories namely before during and after any post operative treatment two of these patients showed favorable responses to the post operative treatment and their average overall cda values declined after the treatment the third patient did not respond well to the post operative treatment and their average overall cda values remained high after the treatment these results indicated that our cda technology may be useful for monitoring a breast cancer patient 146 s response to the post operative treatment although this utility of our cda technology needs more validation studies since 2015 we have been working with multiple hospitals in china including shanghai changhai hospital lishui central hospital a cancer hospital in beijing and a cancer center in shanghai in a number of research studies these studies are designed to explore our cda technology 146 s effectiveness as a prognostic tool for lung cancer treatment in one of these studies in 2016 we collaborated with shanghai changhai hospital and tested and collected the overall cda values from 86 lung cancer patients these patients were divided into two groups the 147 good prognosis 148 group with each member having an overall cda value below 47 and the 147 bad prognosis 148 group those with values above 47 we predicted that the 147 good prognosis 148 group would have a higher survival rate than that of the 147 bad prognosis 148 group due to their relatively low overall cda values after the grouping both groups went through chemotherapy to treat their lung cancers two years after the chemotherapy the survival rate of the 147 bad prognosis 148 group dropped below 50 while that of the 147 good prognosis 148 group stayed at the level of 75 the differences in those two outcomes are statistically significant and meaningful the results of this clinical study demonstrate our cda technology 146 s strong ability in predicting the outcome of lung cancer treatment and validate that it can predict treatment outcomes even before the treatment starts the following graph provides a comparison of the predicted progression free survival rates the percentage of the measured population that did not demonstrate worsening in their condition over a specified period or pfs for those two lung cancer patient groups in this study in another study we tracked a number of patients throughout their approximately three years of cancer treatment the following graph illustrates the changes of a representative patient 146 s cda values throughout the tracking period table of contents cda in long term cancer monitoring stage iia with surgery this patient is a middle aged man diagnosed with a stage iia lung cancer as illustrated in the graph at the beginning of the tracking period namely day zero the patient 146 s overall cda value was relatively high which corroborated the oncologist 146 s diagnosis that the individual had a cancer from day 7 to day 28 as the cancer treatment progressed the patient 146 s overall cda value as well as ptf and ctf values continued dropping after his surgery around day 52 and during his chemo therapy treatment the patient 146 s overall cda value dropped below the cut off value indicating that by that time the patient 146 s stage iia lung cancer had been effectively controlled and he went into remission however after a period of remission around day 212 the patient 146 s overall cda value went up again which predicted a recurrence of cancer shortly after this uptick in the overall cda value the oncologists diagnosed that the patient 146 s cancer had come back and further spread to the liver corroborating our cda test 146 s prediction subsequently the patient went through chemotherapy for liver cancer following this treatment around day 277 the patient showed an overall cda value below the cut off value indicating that the patient responded positively to the chemotherapy and went into remission again and from day 383 to day 904 the patient 146 s overall cda value as well as ptf and ctf values remained relatively low indicating that he was in remission this was also confirmed by the oncologists 146 clinical observations to summarize this representative example has shown that our cda test can i dynamically monitor a patient 146 s treatment progression indicating when the cancer is under control namely when the overall cda value drops below the cut off value and when the patient enters the remission phase namely after the overall cda value stays below the cut off value for a period of time and ii correctly predict cancer recurrence ahead of time namely when the overall cda value resurges and exceeds the cut off value table of contents our cda device our proprietary cda device which we designed in house and is covered by numerous patents is used to conduct cancer screening and detection tests based on our proprietary cda technology this device uses an integrated multi level and multi parameter sensor system to detect multiple biophysical properties in one single blood test we believe that we are one of the first biotechnology companies worldwide to use such a sensor system to detect cancers 146 biophysical properties working mechanism our cda device consists of a blood sample input unit a sample transport unit a sample mixing chamber a testing unit and a data storage unit because our cda technology detects biophysical properties our cda device 146 s sensors play a dominant role in biophysical signal detection our cda device uses a microfluidic device which is connected to a fluid delivery line inside the testing unit this microfluidic device contains three primary components micro channels micro sensors and measurement instruments with automated data recording capabilities after a blood sample goes into the micro channels of the microfluidic device the sensors will probe the blood and measure the relevant data the measurement instrument that interfaces with the sensors applies a constant input to the blood and records the corresponding biophysical responses as a function of time the resulting raw data contains both dynamic and static information which is fed into our proprietary algorithm for further analysis our cda device is much less costly to manufacture than the equipment used by many of our competitors especially the complex and expensive gene sequencing machines used in ct dna based tests and micro electrical mechanical devices used in ctc based tests as a result we can offer our customers cancer screening and detection tests with high accuracy at prices significantly lower than many of our competitors 146 tests operation our cda device is a fully automated system requiring minimal human involvement after collecting blood samples from the individuals all our testing personnel needs to do is to properly place these blood samples on the test tube racks and station the racks inside the sample input unit of our device our device will then automatically complete the subsequent test as programmed including heating the blood samples to prepare them for testing deploying multiple sensors inside the microfluidic device to detect relevant biophysical properties in each blood sample and obtain multi level information discharging the tested blood samples and cleaning the used test tubes and transferring the testing data collected by the microfluidic device including ptf and ctf values to the computer connected to our cda device which will process this testing data with our proprietary algorithm and convert it into an overall cda value a series of cda itemized values will also be generated if we conduct biomarker based tests in combination with our cda test while offering our cancer positioning services based on the resulting cda values our professionals can assess a tested individual 146 s likelihood of having or developing cancers and issue the corresponding cancer risk assessment report we design and configure all of the key components of our cda device and outsource production of these components to a number of qualified contract manufacturers we assemble these components into our cda devices in house we have implemented a strict selection process for our contract manufacturers and evaluate our contract manufacturers 146 qualifications on an ongoing basis we do not disproportionately rely on any particular table of contents contract manufacturer and have not entered into any long term or exclusive supply contract with any of them for our cda device we obtained a class ii medical device manufacture license in june 2013 renewed in 2018 and a class ii medical device registration certificate april 2015 from the nmpa zhejiang branch these licenses along with our clinical laboratory license allow us to manufacture our device in lishui zhejiang and use the device commercially in our licensed clinical laboratories in china while conducting the final assembly testing and packaging of our devices at our plant in lishui zhejiang province we thoroughly inspect the key components of our devices sourced from contract manufacturers and closely follow applicable prc regulations and recognized international quality control standards our cda based tests unlike conventional cancer screening and detection approaches such as imaging technology and tissue biopsy our cda test uses liquid based technology to detect the risk of cancer and non cancerous diseases based on our cda technology it is minimally invasive side effect free and highly automated because it focuses on changes in cancer related biophysical properties as a disease progresses we believe that our cda test can be used for multiple purposes including early cancer screening and detection as well as assistance in cancer diagnosis prognosis and recurrence we maintain a comprehensive and flexible test menu to meet different customers 146 needs our cda test can detect and assess an individual 146 s overall risk of having or developing cancer and we deliver a cancer risk assessment report as the final product of this test this report presents the analytical parameters that our cda test uses including the ptf ctf and overall cda values we set cut off values for the ptf ctf and overall cda values based on the pathological data from our retrospective validation studies and the intended cancer screening and detection objectives ptf or ctf values in excess of the specified cut off values indicate a risk of cancer in addition we set two cut offs to divide the overall cda value into three categories low risk healthy medium risk and high risk these values collectively indicate a tested individual 146 s overall risk level of having or developing cancer without identifying the specific types of cancer that the individual may have for tested individuals with medium or high cancer risks as indicated by the overall cda value we normally suggest in our reports that they get follow up medical examinations on the relevant organs in addition to our cda test a tested individual can pay a premium for our combination tests which also include cancer positioning services to identify the specific type s of cancer that he or she has a medium or high risk of having or developing our combination tests combine our cda tests and on an auxiliary basis biomarker based cancer screening and detection tests performed either by us or by third party clinical laboratories that we engage these combination tests typically use two cubic centimeters of blood from the tested individual to perform our cda test and another three cubic centimeters of blood to perform the biomarker based test in the combination tests our cda technology plays a dominant role in identifying the risk of cancer while biomarkers provide auxiliary information on the types of cancer that may be involved we integrate the results of these two separate tests using our proprietary algorithm and translate them into a series of itemized cda values we then analyze these itemized cda values to identify the cancer type s that a tested individual has a medium or high risk of having or developing these identified cancer types and the tested individual 146 s corresponding risk levels of having or developing them will also be included in that individual 146 s cancer risk assessment report currently we offer seven standardized tests with or without cancer positioning services generally the more cancer types a standardized test with cancer positioning services can identify the higher it is priced in each standardized test with cancer positioning services the specific cancer types that can be identified vary between males and females for instance our popular cda six cancer test with positioning services identifies lung liver stomach and colon cancers for both genders as well as rectal and prostate cancers for males and breast and ovarian cancers for females table of contents representative successful case studies leveraging our proprietary cda technology cda device and algorithm our cda based tests have helped numerous individuals identify their diseases timely efficiently and accurately the following are some representative examples selected from our successful case study pool in china case study 1 a 71 year old man took our test in april 2017 the test results showed that he had a high risk of cancer because his overall cda value was high in addition his relevant itemized cda value exceeded the normal value indicating prostate cancer the customer then visited a grade a hospital for an mri examination which showed no abnormality during this customer 146 s follow up communication with us our customer support and service personnel advised him to further conduct a tissue biopsy test the tissue biopsy showed that he had early stage prostate cancer case study 2 in 2017 a 51 year old man was indicated by our test to have medium overall cancer risk in 2018 he took our test again and this time his overall cancer risk level had risen to 147 high risk 148 the customer was not concerned about our test results until he was found having polyps 151 a common pre cancer disease 151 during a colonoscopy examination he then took a polyps removal surgery during the surgery the surgeons determined that he was actually inflicted by early stage colorectal cancer case study 3 a 65 year old man took our test in april 2017 the test results showed that he had a high risk of cancer as his overall cda value was high in addition his relevant itemized cda value exceeded the normal value indicating lung cancer around the same time the customer conducted a physical examination which corroborated our assessment and showed that an azygos lobe had formed in his right lung and the inferior lobes of both of his lungs had pulmonary shadows the customer then visited a lung cancer hospital for further examination where he was diagnosed with early stage lung cancer commercialization china in china we have established clinical laboratories in lishui zhejiang province and haikou hainan province we obtained the medical institutional practice license from the nhc in 2016 and 2015 respectively for these two laboratories to conduct medical tests each for a five year term our lishui laboratory conducts substantially all of our commercial cda based tests including our cda tests and combination tests as well as a variety of other tests including immunology and biochemical tests we performed our first commercial cda based test in 2015 and have generated revenue in china for four consecutive years the number of our commercial cda based tests we sold increased significantly from 19 336 in 2017 to 41 607 in 2018 and from 29 036 in the nine months ended september 30 2018 to 41 544 in the same period of 2019 in addition to our cda based tests we design annual physical checkup plans for certain of our corporate and life insurance company customers as value added services and to facilitate these customers to procure physical checkup services from third party physical checkup service providers we also sell annual physical checkup packages to our customers which are designed to include our cda based tests as part of the physical checkup services we outsource a substantial portion of these checkup services in these packages to qualified physical checkup institutions as of september 30 2019 we had completed total sales of approximately 130 000 physical checkup packages table of contents we have been piloting our genomics tests in our haikou laboratory operated by our subsidiary shiji hainan which we acquired in november 2017 our genomics tests primarily consist of genetic testing for the purpose of targeted therapy selection and pharmacogenomics and ct dna mutation testing for multiple purposes including early cancer screening and detection and prognosis supported by our diverse tests and services we intend to further expand our customer base in china to achieve this objective we plan to market our tests to chinese hospitals in december 2018 we applied to the nmpa for a class iii medical device registration certificate for our cda device to assist in multi cancer diagnosis we expect that it would take us at least three years to obtain this registration certificate after we obtain this license we will apply to update our medical device manufacture license to include the manufacture of class iii medical devices with these class iii medical device licenses we will be permitted to place our devices within chinese hospitals 146 laboratories to conduct commercial tests there or sell our devices to the hospitals for the purposes of assisting in physicians 146 diagnosis of specified multiple cancers we expect our business in china to expand substantially following the commencement of this commercial cooperation with chinese hospitals united states in the united states we have established a clinical laboratory in san jose california and obtained a clia certificate of registration for this laboratory in march 2019 we currently are permitted to conduct our cda test for research use in the united states we have entered into research agreements with u s universities and academic medical centers and we are in discussions with u s hospitals medical institutions cros managed care companies and other health organizations to conduct research studies on our cda technology in the u s to commercialize our cda test in the united states we intend to initially market it to u s customers as an ldt performed at our san jose laboratory as an ldt pursuant to the fda 146 s current ldt enforcement discretion policy we do not expect that our cda test will require premarket clearance market authorization or approval from the fda prior to marketing because we have received a clia certificate of registration for our san jose laboratory we may begin marketing our test as soon as we complete our validation studies and obtain any state laboratory licenses or other accreditations that we are required to hold in order to offer our cda test in the corresponding states under clia cap and state licensing requirements we are required to validate our cda test with applicable analytical and clinical studies prior to marketing the test as an ldt these studies are designed to demonstrate the performance of the test we have entered into research agreements with u s universities and academic medical centers and we are in discussions with other health organizations to conduct these studies we have voluntarily elected to seek accreditation for our san jose laboratory from the cap to receive cap accreditation we must demonstrate that the san jose laboratory is in compliance with all applicable cap program requirements and clia regulatory requirements by passing an inspection among other things the cap inspection will evaluate our laboratory 146 s processes and procedures personnel qualifications and competency assessment proficiency testing and quality assurance and test method validation if our san jose laboratory has received cap accreditation and a clia certificate of accreditation after we complete our validation studies for the cda test we will be able to market our cda test following the completion of an administrative process to update our test menu with the cap clia and those states in which we are required to hold state laboratory licenses with the exception of new york state assuming that our cda test falls within one of the disciplines for which our san jose laboratory has already received accreditation and a clia certificate of accreditation after we complete our validation studies for the cda test we will be able to update our test menu with the cap electronically and then immediately offer our cda test in those states that do not require us to hold state laboratory licenses in those states where we are required to hold state laboratory licenses we will need to submit applications to update our test menu the timeline for these updates is uncertain and will likely depend on the number of applications received by each state at any particular time upon completion of this process we will be able to offer our cda test throughout the u s with the exception of new york for more information about the state laboratory license of the new york state and its application process see 147 regulations 151 u s regulations 151 federal and state laboratory licensing requirements 148 table of contents research and development the development of our cda technology and device together with our proprietary algorithm is largely attributable to our integrated research and development team that comprises talent from both china and the united states in our research and development center based in shanghai we conduct various ongoing research studies on our cda technology and continue to improve our cda device we believe that our research and development team

esophageal cancer for early cancer screening and detection a hospital in shanghai lung colorectal gastric breast and pancreatic cancers for assistance in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence as well as early cancer screening and detection these ongoing research studies can be categorized into the following three groups by study purpose studies for early cancer screening and detection our current ongoing research studies in collaboration with shanghai changhai hospital are based on our research agreement dated april 2017 these research studies are designed to validate our cda technology for the screening and detection of early stage lung and esophageal cancers according to frost amp sullivan in 2018 there table of contents were approximately 867 500 and 271 600 new incidences of lung cancer and esophageal cancer in china respectively and lung cancer ranked first among the five most frequent cancers in china these two cancers are also generally considered difficult for liquid based technologies to detect with high accuracy according to frost amp sullivan in this project shanghai changhai hospital is required to provide us with approximately 5 000 blood samples for research studies certain preliminary published testing results have shown that our cda technology can detect the risk of nsclc with a sensitivity rate of 85 2 and a specificity rate of 93 0 2019 asco annual meeting j clin oncol 37 e20673 2019 we and a cancer center in shanghai executed a research project agreement in july 2017 in this ongoing research project this cancer center is required to provide us with approximately 200 blood samples for the research study to validate our cda technology 146 s ability to detect the risk of multiple cancer types these cancer types include certain cancers that are generally considered difficult for liquid based technologies to detect such as esophageal cancer we also entered into a research project agreement with a university in shanghai in may 2019 in this ongoing research project this university will provide us with approximately 15 000 blood samples for our research studies for multiple purposes including early cancer screening and detection of multiple cancer types including lung and esophageal cancers as well as assistance in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence in addition in august 2019 we and university of pittsburgh medical center entered into two research agreements under the first of these agreements we retained this university to perform a retrospective blinded research study to validate our cda technology for gynecologic cancer screening this university is required to provide us with at least 20 samples from healthy women and at least 20 samples from ovarian cancer patients for the research study under the second agreement we retained the university to conduct a single blind research study to validate our cda technology for esophageal cancer screening this university is required to provide us with 50 samples for the control group and 50 samples from cancer patients for the research study studies for assistance in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence since may 2017 we have been working with a hospital in shanghai on a research study on our cda technology primarily for assistance in diagnosis prognosis and recurrence under this ongoing study this hospital is expected to provide us with approximately 1 600 blood samples these blood samples are collected from patients diagnosed with different subtypes of lung colorectal gastric breast and pancreatic cancers and at different stages of cancer development by analyzing the pre and post treatment cda values of these patients we have found correlations between the changes in a patient 146 s cda values and the cancer treatment that the patient has received studies for cda technology 146 s application to different oncological areas we have been collaborating with the department of veterinary medicine of the university of california davis in a study on early cancer screening for canines this study which initially ended in may 2018 has been extended to 2020 due to its promising preliminary results including high cda values for dogs with cancer and low to medium cda values for healthy dogs through this study we plan to expand the application of our cda technology to veterinary cancer screening and detection studies for major non cancerous disease detection in addition to the above ongoing studies on our cda technology 146 s applications in oncological areas we are also conducting research on our cda technology 146 s ability to detect the risk of various major non cancerous diseases including lung diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis type ii diabetes heart diseases such as heart failure and arrhythmia liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatitis gastric diseases such as gastritis and gastric polyp and biliary diseases such as calculus of bile duct and cholecystolithiasis our preliminary table of contents research studies indicate that our cda technology is able to distinguish individuals with some major non cancerous diseases from the control group and the cancer group more studies and further analysis of the study results are needed to validate our findings on our cda technology 146 s utility in these major non cancer areas our research on improving our cda device we have conducted substantial research to increase the operational efficiency of our cda device and in turn improve our cda test 146 s signal to noise ratio to further elevate its accuracy our current research in this aspect primarily focuses on enabling our device to improve our cda technology 146 s ability to identify cancer types our cda technology 146 s signal to noise ratio and its testing throughput sales and marketing we currently sell our cancer screening and detection tests only in china we sell our tests primarily to our customers directly as well as through our sales agents such as health management companies and medical device dealers we select our sales agents based on their reputation market coverage sales experience and the size of their sales force and we generally conduct credit assessments of our sales agents we set the prices of our tests primarily based on the numbers of cancers that they test however we do not set the resale prices for our tests which our sales agents typically have the sole discretion to determine we typically give our corporate customers and sales agents a credit term of one to three months for the payments our marketing is focused on expanding the market awareness of our cancer screening and detection test and continuously growing our customer base we primarily deploy our own sales and marketing personnel to market our tests as of september 30 2019 we had 19 sales and marketing personnel in addition to conducting direct sales to our existing customers our sales and marketing personnel prepare and deliver our brochures and product presentations to potential customers and attend academic conferences and industrial exhibitions to advertise our cda technology and tests our sales and marketing personnel are generally well trained and educated about the complexities of our tests and they typically have extensive experience in the cancer early screening and detection field or other medical areas as our business grows we plan to build up our sales and marketing team and strengthen our own sales network in china we also use sales agents to promote our tests by referring our tests to their customers and inviting us to deliver product presentations at their promotional events our sales agents have connected us with their quality customers and enabled us to utilize their network resources for marketing purpose our customers we believe that our cancer screening and detection tests have significant market potential in china as there is strong demand among china 146 s large aging population for early cancer screening and detection services our existing customer base in china consists primarily of life insurance companies and other large corporations generally they are frequent and high volume users of our cancer screening and detection tests because they provide our tests to their individual customers as value added services or to their employees as benefits while a majority of our sales has come from our direct sales to our customers we expect that a significant portion of our sales will continue to be generated through our sales agents we believe our customer base provides a meaningful opportunity for our further growth in addition we believe an expansion in our customer base will encourage the market acceptance of our cda technology and raise the public 146 s awareness of our brand we plan to acquire additional customers for our cda based tests through the annual physical checkup packages we offer in addition we plan to further develop our non cda cancer screening and detection tests using other technologies including expanding the genomics tests we currently conduct at our haikou laboratory after obtaining the class iii medical device registration certificate and updating our medical device manufacture license we expect to provide our tests to more individual customers through chinese hospitals table of contents customer support and service we maintain a dedicated team to provide customer support and service for our cda based tests this shanghai based team is primarily responsible for operating our service hotline to answer customers 146 questions regarding their test results and our cancer risk assessments in addition this team periodically conducts follow up phone consultations with the tested individuals to check their current health conditions diagnosis results and disease development these consultations provide us valuable feedback to validate our cda technology utility in detecting the risk of cancer supply chain and quality control we devote significant attention to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our cancer screening and detection tests we have established a comprehensive quality control system for our tests in accordance with applicable prc regulations and recognized international quality control standards blood samples for our commercial cda based tests are typically delivered to us by a third party commercial courier we have also engaged third party nursing service providers to collect blood samples on our behalf for our commercial cancer screening and detection tests these service providers are generally responsible for any physical harm caused by the nurses to the tested individuals during the blood collection process in addition our research partners are responsible for collecting and delivering blood samples for our research studies as the quality of blood samples directly affects the accuracy of our tests we have designed a set of standardized blood sample collection and delivery procedures including those for sample labeling preservation and transportation we require the commercial courier company nurses and our research partners to follow these standardized procedures to minimize the risks of human errors and sample contamination during the testing process we strictly control the temperature and humidity in our laboratories we carefully preserve the blood samples in a temperature controlled environment we also use control samples to ensure that our tests are properly performed and the test results are reliable after the testing process our designated personnel will verify the testing results before issuing the cancer risk assessment reports to our customers in addition because our cda technology focuses on biophysical signals our blood samples can remain stable for testing purpose for up to seven days we use a relatively small amount of reagents in our biomarker based cancer screening and detection tests which are part of our combination tests we source these reagents from two third party suppliers we do not have an exclusive supply agreement with the supplier the supplier typically engages commercial courier services to deliver the reagents to us in addition we outsourced substantially all of the biomarker based tests in 2017 and 2018 to two third party clinical laboratories on a non exclusive basis these two laboratories are responsible for conducting the biomarker based tests and delivering the test results to us for our data consolidation using our algorithm these two laboratories are obligated to keep confidential all documents relating to the tested samples and the test results we have recently phased out this outsourcing arrangement and are performing our combination tests entirely in house competition as early detection of cancer may lead to decreased morbidity with improved survival more and more biotechnology companies have focused on the immense market opportunities it represents and are attempting to enter the space biotechnology companies worldwide currently use various technologies for early cancer screening and detection we believe that none of these technologies has yet acquired a dominant market position as a novel cancer screening and detection technology that focuses on biophysical properties in blood our cda technology faces competition primarily from conventional biomarker based technologies and other next generation cancer screening and detection technologies including those based on ctcs and ct dnas recent major advances in table of contents ctc and ct dna based technologies have introduced the possibility of using either or both as tests to screen for cancer and they have made the possibility for simultaneous screening for multiple primary cancers particularly attractive our major competitors include biotechnology companies that conduct cancer screening and detection using next generating technologies such as bgi in china and grail guardant health and exact sciences worldwide all of these competitors 146 cancer screening and detection technologies target ctcs and or genomics such as ct dna cf dna and cf rna as opposed to the biophysical properties that our cda technology focuses on according to frost amp sullivan grail guardant health and exact sciences have developed or may develop multi cancer tests that compete with our cda based test and bgi is developing services to evaluate the risk of various cancer types through ct dna tests we believe that our competitive advantages include the cost efficiency high testing accuracy and broad test coverage of our cda based tests our expansive patent portfolio and our large proprietary test database however many of our competitors have more expertise experience and financial resources stronger business relationships in developing and marketing their products more mature technologies and products greater market adoption among physicians and patients and others in the medical community broader test menus larger test databases or greater brand recognition than we do we also cannot assure you that our cda technology will not become obsolete if we cannot keep pace with constantly changing technologies in the cancer screening and detection market intellectual property intellectual property rights are fundamental to our business and we devote significant time and resources to their development and protection we rely on a combination of patent trade secret and trademark laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we do not rely on third party licenses of intellectual property when developing our cda technology and cda device we have developed an early and strong patent position related to our cda technology and we continuously seek patent coverage over its new applications as of september 30 2019 we had filed 210 patent applications globally among them 121 patents had been granted including 16 patents granted in the united states 55 in greater

patents and patent applications broadly cover apparatus and methods for detecting diseases at early stages and they strategically encompass the important specific embodiments of these apparatus and methods they generally fall into the following categories those relating to our cda technology including claims directed to methods for identifying and measuring various biophysical properties in blood samples and methods for detecting major cancer types and or non cancerous diseases such as methods for detecting multiple cancers in a single blood test those relating to our cda device including claims directed to its key components such as the microfluidic those relating to the multi level multi parameter concept underlying our cda technology as well as our non cda early cancer screening and detection technologies apparatus and methods according to our public searches some of our patents including our newly issued u s patents have been cited by patent examiners and third parties including a number of well known global corporations and fortune 50 companies for example as of october 31 2019 one of our u s patents issued in 2018 had been cited 23 times in patent

institutions a medical institution providing relevant services must register and obtain a medical institution practice license an entity or individual that has not obtained a medical institution practice table of contents license may not carry out diagnosis or treatment activities the revised rules for implementation of the administrative regulation on medical institutions as promulgated by the nhfpc in february 2017 further regulates the approval on establishment registration validation naming and practice of medical institutions our prc subsidiaries anpac lishui and shiji hainan obtained their medical institution practice licenses in 2016 and 2015 respectively we historically conducted a number of our cda tests in premises other than our lishui and haikou laboratories which could result in the relevant authorities confiscating the revenue we generated from these tests as well as other penalties on us while we have rectified this practice and have not received any notice of relevant disciplinary governmental action we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to this penalty the measures for the administration of clinical gene amplification testing laboratories in medical institutions as promulgated by ministry of health in december 2010 provides the requirements for medical institutions to carry out clinical gene amplification test technique clinical gene amplification testing laboratory refers to a laboratory that detects specific dna or rna by amplification and to perform disease diagnosis treatment monitoring and prognosis determination the prc

administration of medical devices as amended by the state council in may 2017 regulates entities that engage in the research and development production operation use as well as supervision and administration of medical devices in the prc medical devices are classified according to their risk levels class i medical devices are medical devices with low risks the safety and effectiveness of which can be ensured through routine administration class ii medical devices are medical devices with moderate risks which are strictly controlled and administered to ensure their safety and effectiveness class iii medical devices are medical devices with relatively high risks which are strictly controlled and administered through special measures to ensure their safety and effectiveness the evaluation of the risk levels of medical devices take into consideration the expected objectives structural features methods of use and other factors of medical devices the measures for the supervision and administration of the manufacture of medical device as promulgated by cfda in november 2017 regulates entities that engage in the manufacturing of medical devices in the prc the food and drug administration at or above the county level regulates medical device manufacturing within its administrative region including manufacturing related licensing and registration contract manufacturing and manufacturing quality controls the measures for the supervision and administration of the operation of medical devices as promulgated by cfda in november 2017 regulates entities that

activities involving class iii medical devices our prc subsidiary anpac lishui obtained its class ii medical device manufacture license and registration certificate for our cda device in 2013 renewed in 2018 and 2015 table of contents packaging of medical devices the administrative rules on instruction manuals and labels of medical devices as promulgated by the cfda in 2014 provides the requirements for instruction manuals and labeling of any medical device to be sold and used in the prc the information contained in the instruction manual and label of a medical device must be scientific authentic complete accurate and consistent with product characteristics the information contained in the instruction manual and label of a medical device must be consistent with the relevant information registered or filed for record the information contained in the label of a medical device must be consistent with the relevant information in its instructions we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations in all material respects clinical practice reform in october 2017 the chinese government announced an administrative reform of clinical trial institutions certification of clinical trial institutions by the former cfda and the former nhfpc is no longer required under this reform a clinical trial institution can be engaged by a drug and medical device registration applicant i e a sponsor to conduct a clinical study after it has been duly recorded with the online platform designated by the nmpa in november 2017 the cfda and the nhfpc jointly released the rules for administration of the requirements for and filing of medical devices clinical trial institutions these rules specify requirements for medical devices clinical trial institutions

corresponding professional technical level organization and management capabilities and ethics review capability other significant prc regulations affecting our business activities in china regulation on foreign investment investment activities in the prc by foreign investors are regulated by the catalog for the guidance of foreign investment industry or the catalog which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the mofcom and the national development and reform commission or ndrc the catalog lays out the basic framework for foreign investment in china classifying businesses into three categories with regard to foreign investment 147 encouraged 148 147 restricted 148 and 147 prohibited 148 industries not listed in the catalog are generally deemed as falling into a fourth category 147 permitted 148 unless specifically restricted by other prc laws in addition on june 30 2019 the mofcom and the ndrc jointly promulgated the special management measures negative list for the access of foreign investment or the 2019 negative list which became effective on july 30 2019 to amend the catalog and the previous negative list thereunder investment in medical institutions such as clinical laboratories belongs to the 147 restricted 148 category in particular according to relevant prc foreign investment regulations only domestic companies and foreign invested joint ventures are allowed to hold an nhc medical institution practice license however it is unclear under prc law whether a subsidiary of a wholly foreign owned enterprise is eligible to hold this license we believe that the risks for the nhc medical institution practice license of each of our lishui and haikou laboratories 151 subsidiaries of anpac lishui a wholly foreign owned enterprise 151 being held invalid or revoked by the nhc is remote based on our confirmation with relevant regulatory authorities however we cannot assure you that the relevant regulatory authorities would not change their interpretation or position regarding the relevant laws and regulations on march 15 2019 the national people 146 s congress promulgated the prc foreign investment law or the fil which came into effect on january 1 2020 and replaces the trio of previous laws regulating foreign investment in china namely the sino foreign equity joint venture enterprise law the sino foreign cooperative joint venture enterprise law and the wholly foreign invested enterprise law together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations the fil embodies an expected regulatory trend in prc to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments the table of contents implementation rules to the foreign investment law were promulgated by the state council on december 26 2019 and became effective on january 1 2020 the fil and its implementation rules by means of legislation have established the basic framework for the access promotion protection and administration of foreign investment in view of investment protection and fair competition on december 30 2019 mofcom and the state administration for market regulation jointly promulgated the measures for information reporting on foreign investment which became effective on january 1 2020

bribery are listed in the adverse records of commercial briberies by its provincial health and family planning administrative department pursuant to the provisions on the establishment of adverse records of commercial briberies in the medicine purchase and sales industry which became effective on march 1 2014 provincial health and family planning administrative departments formulate the implementing measures for establishment of adverse records of commercial briberies if a company is listed in the adverse records of commercial briberies for the first time their products may not be purchased by public medical institutions a company will not be penalized by the relevant prc government authorities merely by virtue of having contractual relationships with sales agents or third party promoters who are engaged in bribery activities so long as such company and its employees are not utilizing the sales agents or third party promoters for the implementation of or acting in conjunction with them in the prohibited bribery activities in addition a company is under no legal obligation to monitor the operating activities of its sales agents and third party promoters and will not be subject to penalties or sanctions by relevant prc government authorities as a result of failure to monitor their operating activities we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations in all material respects prc regulation of product liability in addition to the strict new drug approval process certain prc laws have been promulgated to protect the rights of consumers and to strengthen the control of medical products in the prc under current prc law manufacturers and vendors of defective products in the prc may incur liability for loss and injury caused by such products pursuant to the general principles of the civil law of the prc promulgated on april 12 1986 and amended on august 27 2009 a defective product which causes property damage or physical injury to any person may subject the manufacturer or vendor of such product to civil liability for such damage or injury on february 22 1993 the product quality law of the prc or the product quality law was promulgated to supplement the civil law of the prc aiming to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the end users and consumers and to strengthen the supervision and control of the quality of products the product quality law was revised by the ninth national people 146 s congress on july 8 2000 by the eleventh national people 146 s congress on august 27 2009 and by the thirteenth national people 146 s congress on december 29 2018 pursuant to the revised product quality law manufacturers who produce defective products may be subject to civil or criminal liability and have their business licenses revoked the law of the prc on the protection of the rights and interests of consumers was promulgated on october 31 1993 and was amended on august 27 2009 and october 25 2013 to protect consumers 146 rights when they purchase or use goods and accept services all business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and or provide services to customers under the amendments made on october 25 2013 all business operators must pay high attention to protecting customers 146 privacy and strictly keeping confidential any consumer information they obtain during their business operations in addition in extreme situations pharmaceutical product manufacturers and operators may be subject to criminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of customers or other third parties table of contents we are not aware of any material product liability related litigation or other legal proceedings against us arising from the cancer screening and detection tests that we provide to our customers prc tort law under the tort law of the prc which became effective on july 1 2010 if damages to persons are caused by defective products due to the fault of a third party such as the parties providing transportation or warehousing the producers and the sellers of the products have the right to recover their respective losses from such third parties if defective products are identified after they have been put into circulation the producers or the sellers must take remedial measures such as issuance of a warning or recall of products in a timely manner the producers or the sellers will be liable under tort if they fail to take remedial measures in a timely manner or have not made efforts to take remedial measures thus causing damages if the products are produced or sold with known defects causing deaths or severe adverse health issues the infringed party has the right to claim punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages we are not aware of any material torts related litigation or other legal proceedings against us arising from the cancer screening and detection tests that we provide to our customers regulation on intellectual property rights china has made substantial efforts to adopt comprehensive legislation governing intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and domain names patents pursuant to the prc patent law most recently amended in december 2008 and its implementation rules most recently amended in january 2010 patents in china fall into three categories invention utility model and design an invention patent is granted to a new technical solution proposed in respect of a product or method or an improvement of a product or method a utility model is granted to a new technical solution that is practicable for application and proposed in respect of the shape structure or a combination of both of a product a design patent is granted to the new design of a certain product in shape pattern or a combination of both and in color shape and pattern combinations aesthetically suitable for industrial application under the prc patent law the term of patent protection starts from the date of application patents relating to invention are effective for twenty years and utility models and designs are effective for ten years from the date of application the prc patent law adopts the principle of 147 first to file 148 system which provides that where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention a patent will be granted to the person who first files the application existing patents can become narrowed invalidated or unenforceable due to a variety of grounds including lack of novelty creativity and deficiencies in patent application in china a patent must have novelty creativity and practical applicability under the prc patent law novelty means that before a patent application is filed no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in china or overseas or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means whether in or outside of china nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is recorded in patent application documents or patent documents published after the filing date creativity means that compared with existing technology an invention has prominent substantial features and represents notable progress and a utility model has substantial features and represents any progress practical applicability means an invention or utility model can be manufactured or used and may produce positive results patents in china are filed with the state intellectual property office or sipo normally the sipo publishes an application for an invention patent within 18 months after the filing date which may be shortened at the request of applicant the applicant must apply to the sipo for a substantive examination within three years from the date of application table of contents article 20 of the prc patent law provides that for an invention or utility model completed in china any applicant not just chinese companies and individuals before filing a patent application outside of china must first submit it to the sipo for a confidential examination failure to comply with this requirement will result in the denial of any chinese patent for the relevant invention this added requirement of confidential examination by the sipo has raised concerns by foreign companies who conduct research and development activities in china or outsource research and development activities to service providers in china patent enforcement unauthorized use of patents without consent from owners of patents forgery of the patents belonging to other persons or engagement in other patent infringement acts will subject the infringers to infringement liability serious offenses such as forgery of patents may be subject to criminal penalties when a dispute arises out of infringement of the patent owner 146 s patent right chinese law requires that the parties first attempt to settle the dispute through mutual consultation however if the dispute cannot be settled through mutual consultation the patent owner or an interested party who believes the patent is being infringed may either file a civil legal suit or file an administrative complaint with the relevant patent administration authority a chinese court may issue a preliminary injunction upon the patent owner 146 s or an interested party 146 s request before instituting any legal proceedings or during the proceedings damages for infringement are calculated as the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement and if the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement cannot be determined the damages for infringement are calculated as the benefit gained by the infringer from the infringement if it is difficult to ascertain damages in this manner damages may be determined using a reasonable multiple of the license fee under a contractual license statutory damages may be awarded in the circumstances where the damages cannot be determined by the calculation standards described above the damage calculation methods will be applied in the order described above generally the patent owner has the burden of proving that the patent is being infringed however if the owner of an invention patent for manufacturing process of a new product alleges infringement of its patent the alleged infringer has the burden of proof exemptions for unlicensed manufacture use sale or import of patented products the prc patent law provides five exceptions for unauthorized manufacture use sale or import of patented products none of following circumstances are deemed an infringement of the patent rights and any person may manufacture use sell or import patented products without authorization granted by the patent owner as follows any person who uses promises to sell sells or imports any patented product or product directly obtained in accordance with the patented methods after such product is sold by the patent owner or by its licensed entity or individual any person who has manufactured an identical product has used an identical method or has made necessary preparations for manufacture or use prior to the date of patent application and continues to manufacture such product or use such method only within the original scope any foreign transportation facility that temporarily passes through the territory territorial waters or territorial airspace of china and uses the relevant patents in its devices and installations for its own needs in accordance with any agreement concluded between china and that country to which the foreign transportation facility belongs or any international treaty to which both countries are party or on the basis of the principle of reciprocity any person who uses the relevant patents solely for the purposes of scientific research and experimentation or any person who manufactures uses or imports patented drugs or patented medical devices for the purpose of providing information required for administrative approval or manufactures uses or imports patented drugs or patented medical devices for the abovementioned person table of contents however if patented drugs are utilized on the ground of exemptions for unauthorized manufacture use sale or import of patented drugs prescribed in prc patent law such patented drugs cannot be manufactured used sold or imported for any commercial purposes without authorization granted by the patent owner as of september 30 2019 we had 55 granted patents including seven in taiwan and 28 pending patent applications including one in taiwan in greater china and 66 granted patents and 61 pending patent applications outside greater china trade secrets according to the prc anti unfair competition law the term 147 trade secrets 148 refers to technical and business information that is unknown to the public has utility and

contributions within the prescribed time period and impose a late payment fee at the rate of 0 05 per day from the date on which the contribution becomes due if such employer fails to make the overdue contributions within such time limit the relevant administrative department may impose a fine equivalent to one to three times the overdue amount regulations relating to foreign exchange registration of offshore investment by prc residents in july 2014 safe issued the safe circular 37 and its implementation guidelines pursuant to safe circular 37 and its implementation guidelines prc residents including prc institutions and individuals must register with local branches of safe in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment in an overseas special purpose vehicle or spv directly established or indirectly controlled by prc residents for the purposes of offshore investment and financing with their legally owned assets or interests in domestic enterprises or their legally owned offshore assets or interests such prc residents are also required to amend their registrations with safe when there is a change to the basic information of the spv such as changes of a prc resident individual shareholder the name or operating period of the spv or when there is a significant change to the spv such as changes of the prc individual resident 146 s increase or decrease of its capital contribution in the spv or any share transfer or exchange merger division of the spv failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in the circular 37 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate the capital inflow from the offshore entities and settlement of foreign exchange capital and may also subject relevant onshore company or prc residents to penalties under prc foreign exchange administration regulations regulations relating to employee stock incentive plan in february 2012 safe promulgated the stock option rules in accordance with the stock option rules and relevant rules and regulations prc citizens or non prc citizens residing in china for a continuous period of not less than one year who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company subject to a few exceptions are required to register with safe through a domestic qualified agent which could be a prc subsidiary of such overseas listed company and complete certain procedures we and our employees who are prc citizens or who reside in china for a continuous period of not less than one year and who participate in our stock incentive plan will be subject to such regulation in addition the sat has issued circulars concerning employee share options or restricted shares under these circulars employees working in the prc who exercise share options or whose restricted shares vest will be subject to prc individual income tax or the iit the prc subsidiaries of an overseas listed company have obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold iit of these employees related to their share options or restricted shares if the employees fail to pay or the prc subsidiaries fail to withhold their iit according to relevant laws rules and regulations the prc subsidiaries may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other prc government authorities regulations relating to dividend distribution the principal regulations governing distribution of dividends paid by wholly foreign owned enterprises include company law of the prc 1993 as amended in 1999 2004 2005 and 2013 foreign investment enterprise law of the prc 1986 as amended in 2000 and 2016 and administrative rules under the foreign investment enterprise law 1990 as amended in 2001 and 2014 under these laws and regulations foreign invested enterprises in china may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits if any determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations in table of contents addition a wholly foreign owned enterprise in china is required to set aside at least 10 0 of its after tax profit based on prc accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50 0 of its registered capital these reserves are not distributable as cash dividends the foreign invested enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds a prc company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year regulations relating to foreign exchange the principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in china are the foreign exchange administration regulations most recently amended in august 2008 under the foreign exchange administration regulations payments of current account items such as profit distributions and trade and service related foreign exchange transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from safe by complying with certain procedural requirements however approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where rmb is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of china to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency denominated loans in august 2008 safe issued the circular on the relevant operating issues concerning the improvement of the administration of the payment and settlement of foreign currency capital of foreign invested enterprises or safe circular no 142 regulating the conversion by a foreign invested enterprise of foreign currency registered capital into rmb by restricting how the converted rmb may be used safe circular no 142 provides that the rmb capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within china safe also strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the rmb capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign invested enterprises the use of such rmb capital may not be changed without safe 146 s approval and such rmb capital may not in any case be used to repay rmb loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used in march 2015 safe issued safe circular no 19 which took effective and replaced safe circular no 142 on june 1 2015 although safe circular no 19 allows for the use of rmb converted from the foreign currency denominated capital for equity investments in china the restrictions continue to apply as to foreign invested enterprises 146 use of the converted rmb for purposes beyond the business scope for entrusted loans or for inter company rmb loans safe promulgated the notice of the safe on reforming and standardizing the foreign exchange settlement management policy of capital account or circular 16 effective on june 9 2016 which reiterates some of the rules set forth in circular 19 but changes the prohibition against using rmb capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign invested company to issue rmb entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to non associated enterprises violations of safe circular 19 or circular 16 could result in administrative penalties in november 2012 safe promulgated the circular of further improving and adjusting foreign exchange administration policies on foreign direct investment which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure pursuant to this circular the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts e g pre establishment expenses accounts foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts the reinvestment of lawful incomes derived by foreign investors in china e g profit proceeds of equity transfer capital reduction liquidation and early repatriation of investment and purchase and remittance of foreign exchange as a result of capital reduction liquidation early repatriation or share transfer in a foreign invested enterprise no longer require safe approval and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces which was not possible before in addition safe promulgated the circular on printing and distributing the provisions on foreign exchange administration over domestic direct investment by foreign investors and the supporting documents in may 2013 which specifies that the administration by safe or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the prc shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in china based on the registration information provided by safe and its branches table of contents in february 2015 safe promulgated the circular on further simplifying and improving the policies concerning foreign exchange control on direct investment which took effect on june 1 2015 the circular on further simplifying and improving the policies concerning foreign exchange control on direct investment delegates the authority to enforce the foreign exchange registration in connection with the inbound and outbound direct investment under relevant safe rules to certain banks and therefore further simplifies the foreign exchange registration procedures for inbound and outbound direct investment regulations on enterprise income tax pursuant to the eit law effective as of january 2008 and as last amended in december 2018 the income tax rate for both domestic and foreign invested enterprises is 25 with certain exceptions to clarify certain provisions in the eit law the state council promulgated the implementation rules of the eit law in december 2007 which became effective in january 2008 and as amended in april 2019 under the eit law and the implementation rules of the eit law enterprises are classified as either 147 resident enterprises 148 or 147 non resident enterprises 148 besides enterprises established within the prc enterprises established outside of china whose 147 de facto management bodies 148 are located in china are considered 147 resident enterprises 148 and subject to the uniform 25 enterprise income tax rate for their global income in addition the eit law provides that a non resident enterprise refers to an entity established under foreign law whose 147 de facto management bodies 148 are not within the prc but has an establishment or place of business in the prc or does not have an establishment or place of business in the prc but has income sourced within the prc the implementation rules of the eit law provide that since january 2008 an income tax rate of 10 shall normally be applicable to dividends declared to non prc resident enterprise investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in the prc or have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the prc the income tax on the dividends may be reduced pursuant to a tax treaty between china and the jurisdictions in which the non prc shareholders reside other prc national and provincial level laws and regulations we are subject to changing regulations under many other laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities at the national provincial and municipal levels some of which are or may become applicable to our business for example regulations control the confidentiality of patients 146 medical information and the circumstances under which patient medical information may be released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties these laws and regulations governing both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information may become more restrictive in the future we also comply with numerous additional national and provincial laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions manufacturing practices environmental protection and fire hazard control in all material aspects we believe that we are currently in compliance with these laws and regulations however we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition u s regulations federal and state laboratory licensing requirements pursuant to the clia a laboratory that performs testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of disease or the impairment of or assessment of health must hold a certificate applicable to the complexity of the laboratory examinations it performs and it must comply with among other things standards covering operations personnel facilities table of contents administration quality and proficiency testing which are intended to ensure among other things that its clinical laboratory testing services are accurate reliable and timely the clia rules do not apply to research laboratories that test human specimens but do not report patient specific results for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of any disease or impairment of or the assessment of the health of individual patients we obtained a clia certificate of registration for our laboratory in san jose california in march 2019 we have voluntarily elected to participate in the accreditation program of the cap and we are seeking cap accreditation of the san jose laboratory cms the agency that oversees clia has deemed cap standards to be equally or more stringent than clia regulations and has approved cap as a recognized accrediting organization inspection by cap is performed in lieu of cms inspections for accredited laboratories we are awaiting a cap inspection of the san jose laboratory if the cap inspection finds the laboratory to be in compliance with all applicable cap and clia requirements we will receive cap accreditation and a clia certificate of accreditation because a laboratory accredited by the cap laboratory accreditation program is deemed to also comply with clia because we have already obtained a clia certificate of registration once we have completed our validation studies we can offer our test from our san jose laboratory and market it as an ldt to u s customers while we are awaiting the cap inspection and accreditation and a clia certificate of accreditation to maintain and renew our cap accreditation and clia certification we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess our laboratory 146 s compliance with program standards we also may be subject to additional unannounced inspections laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests clia provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations with more stringent requirements than those under u s federal law and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements state laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications specify certain quality control procedures facility requirements or prescribe record maintenance requirements as our current laboratory in the united states is located in the state of california we are required to maintain a california state laboratory license pursuant to the relevant state laws we may also need to maintain licenses in other states with such requirements for non resident laboratories in order to perform tests on samples from patients who reside in those states for example in order to offer our test in new york we must separately apply for a new york state clinical laboratory permit and approval of our test in new york which will require submission of validation data as well as information regarding the test methods among other things other states may currently have or adopt similar licensure requirements in the future we will obtain any such necessary licenses before offering our cancer screening and detection test in a state requiring non resident laboratory licensure failure to comply with clia certification and state clinical laboratory licensure requirements may result in a range of enforcement actions including certificate or license suspension limitation or revocation directed plan of corrective action on site monitoring civil monetary penalties criminal sanctions and revocation of the relevant laboratory 146 s approval to receive medicare and medicaid payment for its services as well as significant adverse publicity regulation of laboratory developed tests ldts have generally been considered by the fda to be tests that are designed developed validated and used within a single laboratory the fda has the authority to regulate such tests as medical devices under the fdca however the fda historically has exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and fda regulations with respect to ldts however in recent years legislative and administrative proposals addressing oversight of ldts were introduced for example in 2014 the fda issued two draft guidance documents or the draft ldt guidance proposing a risk based framework with respect to applying the fda 146 s oversight over ldts the draft ldt guidance stated that the fda intended to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to ldts in a risk based manner consistent with the existing classification of medical devices thus the fda planned to begin to enforce its medical device requirements table of contents including premarket submission requirements on ldts marketed without fda premarket review and authorization in november 2016 the fda announced its intention not to finalize the 2014 draft ldt guidance to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach to ldts and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution in january 2017 the fda issued a discussion paper on possible approaches to the regulation of ldts we expect that new legislative and administrative proposals regarding the oversight of ldts will be introduced from time to time it is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the fda which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to offer our tests as ldts or to develop and introduce new tests as ldts in the foreseeable future although we believe we are within the scope of the fda 146 s policy on enforcement discretion for ldts the initial commercialization and continued commercial availability of an ldt is subject to uncertainty given the fda 146 s latitude in interpreting and applying its laws and policies for example fda does not consider tests to be subject to its ldt enforcement discretion if they are designed or manufactured completely or partly outside of the laboratory that offers and uses them or if they are offered 147 direct to consumer 148 as opposed to being available to patients only when prescribed by a health care provider even for tests that appear to fall within fda 146 s previously stated enforcement discretion the fda may decide to take action against certain ldts on a case by case basis at any time if fda views them as presenting a risk to patients the fda commissioner and the director of fda 146 s cdrh have expressed significant concerns regarding potential disparities in accuracy and quality between some ldts and ivds that have been reviewed and cleared authorized or approved by fda in addition the u s congress has been considering various legislative proposals that would reform fda 146 s regulation of laboratory tests and such legislation might lead to heightened fda scrutiny of ldts particularly new ldts whether such legislation will be enacted and if so what effect it may have on how fda regulates laboratory tests including ldts is unknown if fda disagrees with a laboratory test 146 s ldt status fda may consider the test to be an unapproved medical device may subject the company to fda enforcement action including without limitation requiring the company to seek clearance authorization or approval for the laboratory test regulation of medical devices a medical device is an instrument apparatus implement machine contrivance implant in vitro reagent or other similar or related article including any component part or accessory which is i recognized in the official national formulary or the united states pharmacopoeia or any supplement to them ii intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease in man or other animals or iii intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes ivds are a type of medical device and include reagents and instruments used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases conditions or infections including without limitation the presence of certain chemicals genetic information or other biomarkers predictive prognostic and screening tests can also be ivds in the united states medical devices including ivds are subject to extensive regulation by the fda under the fdca and its implementing regulations and certain other u s federal and state statutes and regulations the laws and regulations govern among other things the design manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion post approval monitoring and reporting distribution and import and export of medical devices failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions such as fda refusal to approve pending pre market approval applications or pmas issuance of warning letters mandatory product recalls import detentions civil monetary penalties and or judicial sanctions such as product seizures injunctions and criminal prosecution table of contents device classification under the fdca medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the risk associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness class i devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls class iii devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device 146 s safety and effectiveness class iii devices must typically be approved by fda before they are marketed most class i devices and a minority of class ii devices are completely exempt from premarket review by fda most class ii and a minority of class i devices require 510 k clearance devices that pose the highest risk including life sustaining life supporting or implantable devices or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510 k cleared device or a 147 pre amendment 148 class iii device in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which pma applications have not been called are placed in class iii requiring pma approval a novel device is placed in class iii by default but it may be eligible to be placed in class i or class ii via 147 de novo 148 classification if it can be shown to pose only low to moderate risk with appropriate regulatory controls the pma approval pathway requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda 146 s satisfaction the 510 k clearance pathway is much less burdensome and time consuming than the pma approval pathway the de novo pathway has an enhanced burden compared to the 510 k clearance pathway but is much less burdensome than a pma approval process the 510 k clearance pathway under the 510 k clearance pathway a device manufacturer must submit to the fda a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is 147 substantially equivalent 148 to a legally marketed predicate device a predicate device may be a previously 510 k cleared device or a pre amendment device unless the fda has issued a regulation calling for pma applications for this device type to be 147 substantially equivalent 148 the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and be shown to be equally safe and effective and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device after the fda accepts the 510 k premarket notification it begins a substantive review by statute the fda is required to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the 510 k notification as a practical matter clearance often takes longer typically ranging from three to nine months or longer and clearance is never assured the fda 146 s 510 k review generally compares a proposed device to a predicate device with respect to intended use and technology design materials software energy source etc the information necessary to show substantial equivalence will depend upon the differences between the proposed device and the predicate device which may include bench cadaver animal and or clinical studies if the fda agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device it will grant clearance to commercially market the device otherwise the device manufacturer must fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the pma approval process or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process after a device receives 510 k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use requires a new 510 k clearance or could require reclassification through the de novo process or a pma approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda can review any such decision if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer 146 s decision not to seek a new 510 k clearance the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510 k clearance de novo classification or pma approval the fda also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until 510 k clearance de novo classification or pma approval is obtained table of contents the de novo pathway devices of a new type that the fda has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into class iii regardless of the level of risk they pose to avoid requiring pma review of low to moderate risk devices classified in class iii by operation of law the u s congress created the de novo pathway that allows the fda to classify a low to moderate risk device not previously classified into class i or ii generally a de novo petition contains a device description indications for use statement proposed labeling data performance testing such as bench testing and or clinical study data the proposed classification and a risk benefit analysis the risk benefit analysis is the key element of a de novo petition and typically includes a summary of the benefits of the device a summary of the known and potential risks any risk mitigations and an explanation of whether the benefits outweigh the risks the timing for review of a de novo petition is less certain than a 510 k fda has agreed to review 55 of de novo submissions received in fiscal year 2019 in 150 calendar days during which a submission is under review at the agency as a practical matter de novo marketing authorization often takes longer ranging from a year or more and marketing authorization is never assured due in part to stoppages of fda 146 s 150 day timeline while the applicant responds to deficiencies identified by fda if the fda authorizes the de novo petition the device may be legally marketed and used as a predicate device for future 510 k submissions if the de novo petition is denied the device remains in class iii and a pma approval may be required before the device may be legally marketed in the united states the pma approval process a device not eligible for 510 k clearance or de novo classification must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda 146 s satisfaction the cost of preparing and submitting a pma is substantial under u s federal law the submission of most pmas is additionally subject to a substantial annually adjusted application user fee for example for fiscal year 2020 the user fee for an original pma is 340 995 satisfaction of fda pre market approval requirements typically takes years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type complexity and novelty of the device or disease a pma application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and also detailed information about the device and its components regarding among other things device design manufacturing and labeling there is typically advisory panel review of the clinical data the fda typically conducts a preapproval inspection of the manufacturer 146 s facilities and may also inspect the clinical trial documentation fda will not approve a device unless compliance is shown with quality system regulation or qsr requirements which impose elaborate testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the review period the fda may also request additional information or clarification of information already provided and the fda may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant requesting the applicant 146 s response to deficiencies communicated by the fda by statute the fda has 180 days to review a filed pma application although the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time if its evaluation of a pma is favorable the fda will issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter an approvable letter usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure a final approval of the pma application when and if these conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the fda the fda will issue a pma approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in this approval letter if any if the fda 146 s evaluation of a pma application or the relevant manufacturing facilities is not favorable the fda will deny approval of the pma application or issue a not approvable letter the fda also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary in which case the pma approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the pma application or table of contents the pma application is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available the pma process can be expensive uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the fda approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the fda for marketing in approving a pma application as a condition of approval the fda may also require some form of post approval study or post market surveillance whereby the applicant conducts a follow up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the fda on the clinical status of these patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device the fda may also approve a pma application with other post approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device such as among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale distribution and use even after approval of a pma new pma applications or pma supplements may also be required for modifications to any approved device including modifications to the manufacturing processes device labeling and device design based on the findings of post approval studies supplements to a pma often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original pma except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original pma post market fda regulation after a medical device enters commercial distribution numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply these include the fda 146 s qsr which require manufacturers including third party manufacturers to follow stringent design testing production control supplier contractor selection complaint handling documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process labeling regulations unique device identification requirements and fda prohibitions against the promotion of devices for uncleared unapproved or off label uses advertising and promotion requirements restrictions on sale distribution or use of a device pma annual reporting requirements pma approval of product modifications or the potential for new 510 k clearances for certain modifications to previously 510 k cleared devices medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur medical device correction and removal reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda their field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the fdca recall requirements including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death an order of repair replacement or refund device tracking requirements and post market surveillance regulations which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device table of contents the fda has broad post market and regulatory enforcement powers medical device manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda and other state local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the qsr and other applicable regulations and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of suppliers failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include sanctions such as warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties unanticipated expenditures repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our devices operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing the fda 146 s refusal of our requests for 510 k clearances de novo classification or premarket approvals of new devices new intended uses or modifications to existing devices the fda 146 s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export devices for sale in other countries and withdrawing 510 k clearances de novo marketing authorization or premarket approvals that have already been granted and criminal prosecution federal and state fraud and abuse laws we are subject to u s federal fraud and abuse laws such as the aks the u s federal prohibition against physician self referral or stark law

overtly or covertly in cash or in kind in return for or to induce the referral of an individual or to purchase lease order arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering any good facility item or service that is reimbursable in whole or in part under a u s federal healthcare program although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor the stark law and similar state laws prohibit physician referral of patients for designated health services payable by medicare medicaid to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship ownership investment interest or compensation arrangement unless an exception applies other u s federal fraud and abuse laws to which we are subject include but are not limited to the u s federal civil and criminal false claims laws including the fca which imposes liability on any person or entity that among other things knowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the u s federal government and the u s federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the offering or transfer of remuneration to a medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know that

states there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes at the u s federal and state levels which seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare for example in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act or the aca became law this law substantially changed the way health care is financed by both commercial payers and government payers and significantly impacted our industry since 2016 there have been efforts to repeal all or part of the aca and the current presidential administration and u s congress have taken action to roll back certain provisions of the aca for example the tax cuts and jobs act among other things removes penalties for not complying with the aca 146 s individual mandate to carry health insurance the current presidential administration and the u s congress may take further action regarding the aca including but not limited to repeal or replacement additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge which could result in lower numbers of insured individuals reduced coverage for insured individuals and adversely affect our business the aca contained a number of provisions expected to impact our business and operations some of which in ways we cannot currently predict including those governing enrollment in state and u s federal health care table of contents programs reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse which will impact existing state and u s federal health care programs and will result in the development of new programs for instance the aca required each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax equal to 2 3 of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices this requirement began to apply to sales of taxable medical devices after december 31 2012 through a series of legislative amendments the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019 absent further legislative action the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting january 1 2020 the taxes imposed by the aca and the expansion in the government 146 s role in the u s healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us and lower reimbursement by payers for our tests any of which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted on august 2 2011 the budget control act of 2011 was signed into law which among other things reduced medicare payments to providers by 2 per fiscal year effective on april 1 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional legislative action is taken we anticipate there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels and by regulators and commercial payers to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our tests and the coverage of or the amounts of reimbursement available for our tests from payers including commercial payers and government payers table of

for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to directors officers or persons controlling the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions the registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable transfer of shares subject to any applicable restrictions or limitations arising pursuant to i our m amp a or ii the bvi act any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or in any other form which our directors may approve such instrument of transfer being signed by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee our directors may decline to register any

market may determine to be payable or such lesser sum as our board of directors may require is paid to our company in respect thereof differences in corporate law the bvi act differs from laws applicable to united states corporations and their shareholders set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the bvi act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the state of delaware mergers consolidations and similar arrangements the bvi act provides for mergers as that expression is understood under us corporate law common law mergers are also permitted outside of the scope of the bvi act under the bvi act two or more companies may either merge into one of such existing companies or the surviving company or consolidate with both existing companies ceasing to exist and forming a new company or the consolidated company the procedure for a merger or consolidation between our company and another company which need not be a bvi company is set out in the bvi act the directors of the bvi company or bvi companies which are to merge or consolidate must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation which must also be authorized by a resolution of members and the outstanding shares of every class of shares that are entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation as a class if the memorandum or articles of association so provide or if the plan of merger or consolidation contains any provisions that if contained in a proposed amendment to the memorandum or articles would entitle the class to table of contents vote on the proposed amendment as a class of the shareholders of the bvi company or bvi companies which are to merge a foreign company which is able under the laws of its foreign jurisdiction to participate in the merger or consolidation is required by the bvi act to comply with the laws of that foreign jurisdiction in relation to the merger or consolidation the bvi company must then execute articles of merger or consolidation containing certain prescribed details the plan and articles of merger or consolidation are then filed with the registrar of corporate affairs in the bvi or the registrar if the surviving company or the consolidated company is to be incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside bvi it shall file the additional instruments required under section 174 2 b of the bvi act the registrar then if he or she is satisfied that the requirements of the bvi act have been complied with registers in the case of a merger the articles of merger or consolidation and any amendment to the m amp a of the surviving company and in the case of a consolidation the m amp a of the new consolidated company and issues a certificate of merger or consolidation which is conclusive evidence of compliance with all requirements of the bvi act in respect of the merger or consolidation the merger or consolidation is effective on the date that the articles of merger or consolidation are registered by the registrar or on such subsequent date not exceeding thirty days as is stated in the articles of merger or consolidation but if the surviving company or the consolidated company is a company incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the bvi the merger or consolidation is effective as provided by the laws of that other jurisdiction as soon as a merger or consolidation becomes effective among other things a the surviving company or consolidated company so far as is consistent with its amended memorandum and articles of association as amended or established by the articles of merger or consolidation has all rights privileges immunities powers objects and purposes of each of the constituent companies b the memorandum and articles of association of any surviving company are automatically amended to the extent if any that changes to its amended memorandum and articles of association are contained in the articles of merger c assets of every description including choses in action and the business of each of the constituent companies immediately vest in the surviving company or consolidated company d the surviving company or consolidated company is liable for all claims debts liabilities and obligations of each of the constituent companies e no conviction judgment ruling order claim debt liability or obligation due or to become due and no cause existing against a constituent company or against any shareholder director officer or agent thereof is released or impaired by the merger or consolidation and f no proceedings whether civil or criminal pending at the time of a merger or consolidation by or against a constituent company or against any shareholder director officer or agent thereof are abated or discontinued by the merger or consolidation but i the proceedings may be enforced prosecuted settled or compromised by or against the surviving company or consolidated company or against the shareholder director officer or agent thereof as the case may be or ii the surviving company or consolidated company may be substituted in the proceedings for a constituent company but if the surviving company or the consolidated company is incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the bvi the effect of the merger or consolidation is the same as noted foregoing except in so far as the laws of the other jurisdiction otherwise provide the registrar shall strike off the register of companies each constituent company that is not the surviving company in the case of a merger and all constituent companies in the case of a consolidation save that this shall not apply to a foreign company if the directors determine it to be in the best interests of us it is also possible for a merger to be approved as a court approved plan of arrangement or as a scheme of arrangement in accordance with in each such case the bvi act the convening of any necessary shareholders meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be authorized by the bvi court a scheme of arrangement requires the approval of 75 of the votes of the shareholders or class of shareholders as the case may be if the effect of the scheme is different in relation to different shareholders it may be necessary for them to vote separately in relation to the scheme with it being required to secure the requisite approval level of each separate voting group under a plan of arrangement a bvi court may determine what shareholder approvals are required and the manner of obtaining the approval table of contents shareholders 146 suits under the provisions of the bvi act the memorandum and articles of association of a company are binding as between the company and its members and between the members in general members are bound by the decision of the majority or special majorities as set out in the articles of association or in the bvi act as for voting the usual rule is that with respect to normal commercial matters members may act from self interest when exercising the right to vote attached to their shares if the majority members have infringed a minority member 146 s rights the minority may seek to enforce its rights either by derivative action or by personal action a derivative action concerns the infringement of the company 146 s rights where the wrongdoers are in control of the company and are preventing it from taking action whereas a personal action concerns the infringement of a right that is personal to the particular member concerned the bvi act provides for a series of remedies available to members where a company incorporated under the bvi act conducts some activity which breaches the bvi act or the company 146 s memorandum and articles of association the bvi high court can issue a restraining or compliance order members can now also bring derivative personal and representative actions under certain circumstances the traditional english basis for members 146 remedies have also been incorporated into the bvi act where a member of a company considers that the affairs of the company have been are being or are likely to be conducted in a manner likely to be oppressive unfairly discriminating or unfairly prejudicial to him he may apply to the bvi high court for an order on such conduct any member of a company may apply to the bvi high court for the appointment of a liquidator for the company and the court may appoint a liquidator for the company if it is of the opinion that it is just and equitable to do so the bvi act provides that any member of a company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting from any of the following a consolidation any sale transfer lease exchange or other disposition of more than 50 per cent in value of the assets or business of the company if not made in the usual or regular course of the business carried on by the company but not including i a disposition pursuant to an order of the court having jurisdiction in the matter ii a disposition for money on terms requiring all or substantially all net proceeds to be distributed to the members in accordance with their respective interest within one year after the date of disposition or iii a transfer pursuant to the power of the directors to transfer assets for the protection thereof a redemption of 10 per cent or fewer of the issued shares of the company required by the holders of 90 percent or more of the shares of the company pursuant to the terms of the bvi act and an arrangement if permitted by the bvi high court generally any other claims against a company by its members must be based on the general laws of contract or tort applicable in the bvi or their individual rights as members as established by the company 146 s memorandum and articles of association the bvi act provides that if a company or a director of a company engages in proposes to engage in or has engaged in conduct that contravenes the bvi act or the memorandum or articles of association of the company the bvi high court may on the application of a member or a director of the company make an order directing the company or director to comply with or restraining the company or director from engaging in conduct that contravenes the bvi act or the memorandum or articles of association table of contents indemnification of directors and executive officers and limitation of liability bvi law does not limit the extent to which a company 146 s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors except to the extent any such provision may be held by the bvi high court to be contrary to public policy e g for purporting to provide indemnification against the consequences of committing a crime an indemnity will be void and of no effect and will not apply to a person unless the person acted honestly and in good faith and in what he believed to be in the best interests of the company and in the case of criminal proceedings the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful our memorandum and articles of association provide that every director and officer of our company shall be indemnified against all actions proceedings costs charges expenses losses damages or liabilities incurred or sustained by such indemnified person other than by reason of such indemnified person 146 s own dishonesty wilful default or fraud in or about the conduct of our company 146 s business or affairs including as a result of any mistake of judgment or in the execution or discharge of his duties powers authorities or discretions including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing any costs expenses losses or liabilities incurred by such indemnified person in defending whether successfully or otherwise any civil proceedings concerning our company or its affairs in any court whether in the british virgin islands or elsewhere this standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the delaware general corporation law for a delaware corporation in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our memorandum and articles of association insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to our directors officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions we have been informed that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable directors 146 fiduciary duties under delaware corporate law a director of a delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders this duty has two components the duty of care and the duty of loyalty the duty of care requires that a director act in good faith with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances under this duty a director must inform himself of and disclose to shareholders all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction the duty of loyalty requires that a director acts in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation he or she must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage this duty prohibits self dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally in general actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation however this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director the director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation as a matter of bvi law directors must not place themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests this means that strictly speaking a director should not participate in a decision in circumstances where he has a potential conflict that is he should declare his interest and abstain the bvi act provides that a director 147 shall forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by the company disclose the interest to the board of the company 148 the failure of a director to so disclose an interest does not affect the validity of a transaction entered into by the director or the company provided that the director 146 s interest was disclosed to the board prior to the company 146 s entry into the transaction or was not required to be disclosed for example where the transaction is between the company and the director himself or is otherwise in the ordinary course of business table of contents and on usual terms and conditions typically a company 146 s memorandum and articles of association will allow a director interested in a particular transaction to vote on it attend meetings at which it is considered and sign documents on behalf of the company which relate to the transaction under the laws of the bvi a transaction entered into by the company in respect of which a director is interested will not be voidable by the company where the members have approved or ratified the transaction in knowledge of the material facts of the interest of the director in the transaction or if the company received fair value for the transaction broadly speaking the duties that a director owes to a company may be divided into two categories the first category encompasses fiduciary duties that is the duties of loyalty honesty and good faith the second category encompasses duties of skill and care each is considered in turn below a director 146 s fiduciary duties can be summarized as follows bona fides the directors must act bona fide in what they consider is in the best interests of the company or if permitted as above that company 146 s parent company proper purpose the directors must exercise the powers that are vested in them for the purpose for which they were conferred and not for a collateral purpose unfettered discretion since the powers of the directors are to be exercised by them in trust for the company they should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion conflict of duty and interest as per the above in addition to their fiduciary duties a director has the duties of care diligence and skill which are owed to the company itself and not for example to individual members subject to the limited exceptions as to enforcement on behalf of the company shareholder action by written consent under the delaware general corporation law a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation as permitted by bvi law our articles of association provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of each shareholder who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held shareholder proposals under the delaware general corporation law a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents a special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings bvi law and our m amp a provide that upon the written request of shareholders entitled to exercise thirty per cent 30 or more of the voting rights in respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested the directors shall convene a meeting of shareholders as a bvi company we are not obliged by law to call shareholders 146 annual general meetings cumulative voting under the delaware general corporation law cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation 146 s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it cumulative voting potentially table of contents facilitates the representation of investors on a board of directors since it permits the investor to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director which increases the shareholder 146 s voting power with respect to electing such director there are no prohibitions in relation to cumulative voting under the laws of the british virgin islands but our articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting as a result our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a delaware corporation removal of directors under the delaware general corporation law a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise under our articles of association a director may be removed from office with or without cause by a resolution of shareholders passed at a meeting of shareholders called for the purposes of removing the director or for purposes including the removal of the director or by a written resolution passed by a least fifty per cent 50 of the shareholders of the company entitled to vote transactions with interested shareholders the delaware general corporation law contains a business combination statute applicable to delaware corporations whereby unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an 147 interested shareholder 148 for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder an interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15 or more of the target 146 s outstanding voting share within the past three years this has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally the statute does not apply if among other things prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder this encourages any potential acquirer of a delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target 146 s board of directors british virgin islands law has no comparable statute as a result we are not afforded the same statutory protections in the british virgin islands as we would be offered by the delaware business combination statute however although british virgin islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the investors see also 147 shareholders 146 suits 148 above we have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics which requires employees to fully disclose any situations that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest and sets forth relevant restrictions and procedures when a conflict of interest arises to ensure the best interest of the company dissolution winding up under the delaware general corporation law unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100 of the total voting power of the corporation only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation 146 s outstanding shares delaware law allows a delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board the liquidation of a company may be a voluntary solvent liquidation or a liquidation under the insolvency act where a company has been struck off the register of companies under the bvi act continuously for a period of seven years it is dissolved with effect from the last day of that period voluntary liquidation if the liquidation is a solvent liquidation the provisions of the bvi act governs the liquidation a company may only be liquidated under the bvi act as a solvent liquidation if it has no liabilities or it is able to pay its debts as they fall due and the value of its assets exceeds its liabilities subject to the memorandum and articles of table of contents association of a company a liquidator may be appointed by a resolution of directors or resolution of members but if the directors have commenced liquidation by a resolution of directors the members must approve the liquidation plan by a resolution of members save in limited circumstances a liquidator is appointed for the purpose of collecting in and realizing the assets of a company and distributing proceeds to creditors liquidation under the insolvency act the insolvency act governs an insolvent liquidation pursuant to the insolvency act a company is insolvent if it fails to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not be set aside pursuant to the insolvency act execution or other process issued on a judgment decree or order of court in favor of a creditor of the company is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied or either the value of the company 146 s liabilities exceeds its assets or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due the liquidator must be either the official receiver in bvi or a bvi licensed insolvency practitioner an individual resident outside the bvi may be appointed to act as liquidator jointly with a bvi licensed insolvency practitioner or the official receiver the members of the company may appoint an insolvency practitioner as liquidator of the company or the court may appoint an official receiver or an eligible insolvency practitioner the application to the court can be made by one or more of the following i the company ii a creditor iii a member or iv the supervisor of a creditors 146 arrangement in respect of the company the financial services commission and the attorney general in the bvi the court may appoint a

of an investment in our class a ordinary shares or adss is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this registration statement all of which are subject to change this summary does not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in our class a ordinary shares or adss such as the tax consequences under u s state and local tax laws or under the tax laws of jurisdictions other than the bvi the people 146 s republic of china and the united states bvi taxation our company and all dividends interest rents royalties compensation and other amounts paid by our company to persons who are not resident in the bvi and any capital gains realized with respect to any shares debt obligations or other securities of our company by persons who are not resident in the bvi are exempt from all provisions of the income tax ordinance in the bvi no estate inheritance succession or gift tax rate duty levy or other charge is payable by persons who are not resident in the bvi with respect to any shares debt obligation or other securities of our company all instruments relating to transfers of property to or by our company and all instruments relating to transactions in respect of the shares debt obligations or other securities of our company and all instruments relating to other transactions relating to the business of our company are exempt from payment of stamp duty in the bvi this assumes that our company does not hold an interest in real estate in the bvi there are currently no withholding taxes or exchange control regulations in the bvi applicable to our company or its members people 146 s republic of china taxation under the prc eit law and its implementation rules an enterprise established outside the prc with a 147 de facto management body 148 within the prc is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25 on its global income the implementation rules define the term 147 de facto management body 148 as the body that exercises full and substantial control over and overall management of the business production personnel accounts and properties of an enterprise in april 2009 the sat issued the circular of the sat on issues relating to identification of prc controlled overseas registered enterprises as resident enterprises in accordance with the de facto standards of organizational management or sat circular 82 which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the 147 de facto management body 148 of a prc controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in china although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by prc enterprises or prc enterprise groups not those controlled by prc individuals or foreigners the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the sat 146 s general position on how the 147 de facto management body 148 test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises according to sat circular 82 an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a prc enterprise or a prc enterprise group will be regarded as a prc tax resident by virtue of having its 147 de facto management body 148 in the prc only if all of the following conditions are met i the primary location of the day to day operational management is in the prc ii decisions relating to the enterprise 146 s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the prc iii the enterprise 146 s primary assets accounting books and records company seals and board and shareholder resolutions are located or maintained in the prc and iv at least 50 of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the prc we do not believe that anpac bio meets all of the conditions above anpac bio is a company incorporated outside the prc as a holding company its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries and its key table of contents assets are located and its records including the resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of its shareholders are maintained outside the prc for the same reasons we believe our other entities outside of the prc are not prc resident enterprises either however the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the prc tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term 147 de facto management body 148 there can be no assurance that the prc government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with ours if the prc tax authorities determine that anpac bio is a prc resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes we may be required to withhold a 10 withholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non resident enterprises including the holders of our adss in addition non resident enterprise shareholders including our ads holders may be subject to a 10 prc tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of adss or class a ordinary shares if such income is treated as sourced from within the prc it is unclear whether our non prc individual shareholders including our ads holders would be subject to any prc tax on dividends or gains obtained by such non prc individual shareholders in the event we are determined to be a prc resident enterprise if any prc tax were to apply to such dividends or gains it would generally apply at a rate of 20 unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable tax treaty however it is also unclear whether non prc shareholders of anpac bio would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the prc in the event that anpac bio is treated as a prc resident enterprise provided that our bvi holding company anpac bio is not deemed to be a prc resident enterprise holders of our adss and class a ordinary shares who are not prc residents will not be subject to prc income tax on dividends distributed by us or gains realized from the sale or other disposition of our shares or adss however under sat public notice 7 and sat public notice 37 where a non resident enterprise conducts an 147 indirect transfer 148 by transferring taxable assets including in particular equity interests in a prc resident enterprise indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company the non resident enterprise being the transferor or the transferee or the prc entity which directly owned such taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer using a 147 substance over form 148 principle the prc tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing avoiding or deferring prc tax as a result gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to prc enterprise income tax and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of 10 for the transfer of equity interests in a prc resident enterprise we and our non prc resident investors may be at risk of being required to file a return and being taxed under sat public notice 7 and sat public notice 37 and we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with sat public notice 7 and sat public notice 37 or to establish that we should not be taxed under these circulars see 147 risk factors 151 risks relating to doing business in china 151 we face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in prc resident enterprises by their non prc holding companies 148 united states federal income tax considerations the following is a summary of material u s federal income tax considerations that are likely to be relevant to the purchase ownership and disposition of our class a ordinary shares or adss by a u s holder as defined below this summary is based on provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the 147 code 148 and regulations rulings and judicial interpretations thereof in force as of the date hereof those authorities may be changed at any time perhaps retroactively so as to result in u s federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below this summary is not a comprehensive discussion of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular investor 146 s decision to purchase hold or dispose of class a ordinary shares or adss in particular this summary is directed only to u s holders that acquire class a ordinary shares or adss in this offering and hold table of contents such class a ordinary shares or adss as capital assets and does not address particular tax consequences that may be applicable to u s holders who may be subject to special tax rules such as banks brokers or dealers in securities or currencies traders in securities electing to mark to market financial institutions life insurance companies tax exempt entities regulated investment companies entities or arrangements that are treated as partnerships for u s federal income tax purposes or partners therein holders that own or are treated as owning 10 or more of our stock by vote or value persons holding class a ordinary shares or adss as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or a straddle or persons whose functional currency is not the u s dollar moreover this summary does not address state local or non u s taxes the u s federal estate and gift taxes the medicare contribution tax applicable to net investment income of certain non corporate u s holders or alternative minimum tax consequences of acquiring holding or disposing of class a ordinary shares or adss for purposes of this summary a 147 u s holder 148 is a beneficial owner of class a ordinary shares or adss that is a citizen or resident of the united states or a u s domestic corporation or that otherwise is subject to u s federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of such class a ordinary shares or adss you should consult your own tax advisors about the consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of the class a ordinary shares or adss including the relevance to your particular situation of the considerations discussed below and any consequences arising under non u s state local or other tax laws adss in general if you are a u s holder of adss you will be treated for u s federal income tax purposes as the beneficial owner of the underlying class a ordinary shares that are represented by those adss references to 147 shares 148 below apply to both class a ordinary shares and adss unless the context indicates otherwise taxation of dividends subject to the discussion below under 147 passive foreign investment company status 148 the gross amount of any distribution of cash or property with respect to our shares including amounts if any withheld in respect of prc taxes that is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for u s federal income tax purposes will generally be includible in your taxable income as ordinary dividend income on the day on which you receive the dividend in the case of class a ordinary shares or the date the depositary receives the dividends in the case of adss and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to u s corporations under the code we do not expect to maintain calculations of our earnings and profits in accordance with u s federal income tax principles u s holders therefore should expect that distributions generally will be treated as dividends for u s federal income tax purposes subject to certain exceptions for short term and hedged positions the dividends received by a non corporate u s holder with respect to the shares will be subject to taxation at a preferential rate if the dividends are 147 qualified dividends 148 dividends paid on the shares will be treated as qualified the shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states or we are eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the united states that the u s treasury determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and that includes an exchange of information program and we were not in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid and are not in the year in which the dividend is paid a pfic the adss have been approved for listing on the nasdaq global market and the adss will qualify as readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states so long as they are so listed based on table of contents our audited financial statements the manner in which we conduct our business and relevant market and shareholder data we do not believe we were a pfic for u s federal income tax purposes with respect to our prior taxable year in addition based on our audited financial statements the manner in which we conduct our business relevant market and shareholder data and our current expectations regarding the value and nature of our assets and the sources and nature of our income we do not anticipate becoming a pfic for our current taxable year or in the foreseeable future u s holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of their own particular circumstances because the class a ordinary shares are not themselves listed on a u s exchange dividends received with respect to class a ordinary shares that are not represented by adss may not be treated as qualified dividends u s holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in respect of the class a ordinary shares in the event that we are deemed to be a prc resident enterprise under the prc eit law see 147 taxation 151 people 146 s republic of china taxation 148 a u s holder may be subject to prc withholding taxes on dividends paid on our shares in that case we may however be eligible for the benefits of the agreement between the government of the united states of america and the government of the people 146 s republic of china for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of tax evasion with respect to taxes on income the 147 treaty 148 if we are eligible for such benefits dividends we pay on our shares would be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation described above assuming we are not a pfic in the year the dividend is paid or the prior year dividend distributions with respect to our shares generally will be treated as 147 passive category 148 income from sources outside the united states for purposes of determining a u s holder 146 s u s foreign tax credit limitation subject to the limitations and conditions provided in the code and the applicable u s treasury regulations a u s holder may be able to claim a foreign tax credit against its u s federal income tax liability in respect of any prc income taxes withheld at the appropriate rate applicable to the u s holder from a dividend paid to such u s holder alternatively the u s holder may deduct such prc income taxes from its u s federal taxable income provided that the u s holder elects to deduct rather than credit all foreign income taxes for the relevant taxable year the rules with respect to foreign tax credits are complex and involve the application of rules that depend on a u s holder 146 s particular circumstances accordingly u s holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit or the deductibility of foreign taxes under their particular circumstances u s holders that receive distributions of additional shares or rights to subscribe for shares as part of a pro rata distribution to all our shareholders generally will not be subject to u s federal income tax in respect of the distributions unless the u s holder has the right to receive cash or property in which case the u s holder will be treated as if it received cash equal to the fair market value of the distribution taxation of dispositions of shares subject to the discussion below under 147 passive foreign investment company status 148 upon a sale exchange or other taxable disposition of the shares u s holders will realize gain or loss for u s federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the u s holder 146 s adjusted tax basis in the shares such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will generally be long term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year long term capital gain realized by a u s holder that is an individual generally is subject to taxation at a preferential rate the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations gain if any realized by a u s holder on the sale or other disposition of the shares generally will be treated as u s source income for u s foreign tax credit purposes consequently if a prc tax is imposed on the sale or other disposition of the shares a u s holder who does not receive significant foreign source income from other sources may not be able to derive effective u s foreign tax credit benefits in respect of such prc tax however in the event that gain from the disposition of the shares is subject to tax in the prc and a u s holder is eligible table of contents for the benefits of the treaty such u s holder may elect to treat such gain as prc source gain under the treaty u s holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foreign tax credit rules to their investment in and disposition of the shares deposits and withdrawals of class a ordinary shares by u s holders in exchange for adss will not result in the realization of gain or loss for u s federal income tax purposes passive foreign investment company status special u s tax rules apply to companies that are considered to be pfics we will be classified as a pfic in a particular taxable year if taking into account our proportionate share of the income and assets of our subsidiaries under applicable 147 look through 148 rules either 75 percent or more of our gross income for the taxable year is passive income or the average percentage of the value of our assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income is based on the average of four quarterly testing dates at least 50 percent the 147 asset test 148 for this purpose passive income generally includes dividends interest royalties and rents other than royalties and rents derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and not derived from a related person if we own at least 25 by value of the stock of another corporation for purposes of determining whether we are a pfic we will be treated as owning our proportionate share of the other corporation 146 s assets and receiving our proportionate share of the other corporation 146 s income the asset test is generally applied using the fair market values of a non u s corporation 146 s assets the asset test is applied using adjusted tax bases of the assets however if the non u s corporation is a cfc and is not publicly traded for the year we are likely to be a cfc following the transition to a dual class structure and will become publicly traded as a result of the offering it is not entirely clear under current law how the asset test should be applied when a non u s corporation is either a cfc or is not publicly traded for only part of the year we believe however that it is reasonable for shareholders to apply the asset test using fair market values of our assets for each quarter that we either are not a cfc or are publicly traded although the irs could take a different position recently proposed treasury regulations would if finalized in their current form clarify the law by providing that the fair market values of our assets should be used unless we are a cfc for a majority of the year and our stock is not publicly traded for a majority of the year those regulations are proposed to be effective however only for taxable years of u s holders that begin after the regulations are published in final form which would mean that they will not be effective until at least 2020 for any u s holder that uses the calendar year as its taxable year we expect we would be treated as publicly traded for 2020 and subsequent years u s holders including in particular such u s holders that have a tax year other than the calendar year should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules and the appropriate valuation of our assets for purposes of the pfic asset test as well as the desirability of making a mark to market election discussed below subject to the foregoing discussion based on our audited financial statements the manner in which we conduct our business relevant market and shareholder data and our current expectations regarding the value and nature of our assets and the sources and nature of our income we do not believe that we were a pfic in our taxable year ending december 31 2018 and we do not anticipate becoming a pfic for our current taxable year or in the foreseeable future however because the pfic tests must be applied each year and the composition of our income and assets and the value of our assets may change it is possible that we may become a pfic in the current or a future year in particular because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market price of our adss fluctuations in the market price of our adss may cause us to become a pfic for the current or subsequent taxable years the determination of whether we are a pfic also may be affected by the cash raised in this offering and how and how quickly we use that cash and our other liquid assets if we do not deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes our risk of being a pfic may increase table of contents in the event that we are classified as a pfic in any year during which a u s holder holds our shares and such u s holder does not make a mark to market election as described in the following paragraph the u s holder will be subject to a special tax at ordinary income tax rates on 147 excess distributions 148 including certain distributions by us generally distributions that are greater than 125 of the average annual distributions received during the shorter of the three preceding taxable years or the u s holder 146 s holding period for the shares and gain that the u s holder recognizes on the sale or other disposition of our shares the amount of income tax on any excess distributions will be increased by an interest charge to compensate for tax deferral calculated as if the excess distributions were earned ratably over the period that the u s holder holds its shares further if we are a pfic for any year during which a u s holder holds our shares we generally will continue to be treated as a pfic for all subsequent years during which such u s holder holds our shares unless we cease to be a pfic and the u s holder makes a special 147 purging 148 election on irs form 8621 classification as a pfic may also have other adverse tax consequences including in the case of individuals the denial of a step up in the basis of his or her shares at death a u s holder may be able to avoid the unfavorable rules described in the preceding paragraph by electing to mark its adss to market provided the adss are treated as 147 marketable stock 148 the adss generally will be treated as marketable stock if the adss are 147 regularly traded 148 on a 147 qualified exchange or other market 148 which includes the nasdaq global market it should also be noted that it is not currently intended that the class a ordinary shares will be listed on any stock exchange consequently a u s holder that holds class a ordinary shares that are not represented by adss may not be eligible to make a mark to market election if the u s holder makes a mark to market election i the u s holder will be required in any year in which we are a pfic to include as ordinary income the excess of the fair market value of its adss at year end over the u s holder 146 s basis in those adss and ii the u s holder will be entitled to deduct as an ordinary loss in each such year the excess of the u s holder 146 s basis in its adss over their fair market value at year end but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark to market election a u s holder 146 s adjusted tax basis in its adss will be increased by the amount of any income inclusion and decreased by the amount of any deductions under the mark to market rules in addition any gain the u s holder recognizes upon the sale of the u s holder 146 s adss in a year in which we are pfic will be taxed as ordinary income in the year of sale and any loss the u s holder recognizes upon the sale will be treated as ordinary loss but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark to mark election a u s holder that owns an equity interest in a pfic must annually file irs form 8621 a failure to file one or more of these forms as required may toll the running of the statute of limitations in respect of each of the u s holder 146 s taxable years for which such form is required to be filed as a result the taxable years with respect to which the u s holder fails to file the form may remain open to assessment by the irs indefinitely until the form is filed if we are a pfic for any taxable year during which a u s holder holds our shares and any of our non u s subsidiaries is also a pfic such u s holder will be treated as owning a proportionate amount by value of the shares of the lower tier pfic for purposes of the application of the pfic rules u s holders should consult their own tax advisors about the possible application of the pfic rules to any of our subsidiaries u s holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the u s federal income tax considerations discussed above and the desirability of making a mark to market election foreign financial asset reporting certain u s holders that own 147 specified foreign financial assets 148 with an aggregate value in excess of u s 50 000 are generally required to file an information

cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued the costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interests the excess of i the total of the cost of the acquisition fair value of the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value of any

the identifiable net assets of the acquiree the difference is recognized directly in earnings the determination and allocation of fair values to the identifiable net assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable judgment the most significant variables in these valuations are discount rates

used to determine the cash inflows and outflows the group determines discount rates to be used based on the risk inherent in the acquiree 146 s current business model and industry comparisons although the group believes that the assumptions applied in the determination are reasonable based on information available at the date of acquisition actual results may differ from forecasted amounts and the differences could be material intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization all intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives intangible assets have estimated useful lives from the date of purchase estimated useful life medical license goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed of an acquired business the group 146 s goodwill at december 31 2017 and 2018 was related to its business acquisition in november 2017 goodwill acquired in a business combination are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist in accordance with asc 350 20 the group has assigned and assessed goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below the operating segment the group has determined that it has one reporting unit which is also its only reportable segment the group has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step test in accordance with asc 350 20 goodwill if the group believes as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the two step quantitative impairment test described above is required otherwise no further testing is required in the qualitative assessment the group considers primary factors such as industry and market considerations overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other specific information related to the operations in performing the two step quantitative impairment test the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value of the reporting unit based on either quoted market prices of the ordinary shares or estimated fair value using a combination of the income approach and the market approach if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and the group is not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then the group must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit 146 s goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than its implied fair value the excess is recognized as an impairment loss table of contents anpac bio medical science co ltd notes to the consolidated financial statements 151 continued amounts in thousands of rmb and us except for number of shares and per share data summary of principal accounting policies continued goodwill continued in 2017 and 2018 the group performed a qualitative assessment for the reporting unit based on the requirements of asc 350 20 the group evaluated all relevant factors weighed all factors in their entirety and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount therefore no goodwill impairment was recognized as of december 31 2017 and 2018 impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill the group evaluates its long lived assets including property and equipment and intangibles with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable when these events occur the group evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets the group recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value fair value is generally determined by discounting the cash flows expected to be generated by the assets when the market prices are not readily available the adjusted carrying amount of the assets become new cost basis and are depreciated over the assets 146 remaining useful lives long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities fair value of financial instruments the group applies asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures 147 asc 820 148 asc 820 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements asc 820 establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 151 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level 2 151 other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace level 3 151 unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity asc 820 describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities 1 market approach 2 income approach and 3 cost approach the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset the group 146 s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivables accounts payable other receivables other payables and short term debt the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short term maturities table of contents anpac bio medical science co ltd notes to the consolidated financial statements 151 continued

the fair value option to account for its convertible loans the fair value of the convertible loans as of december 31 2018 was rmb17 961 us 2 612 calculated using the scenario analysis method based on probability of remaining as straight debt using discounted cash flow and equity based on the premium conversion ratio of 25 respectively the convertible loans are classified as level 3 instruments as the valuation was determined based on unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the group 146 s own assumptions in measuring fair value significant inputs used in developing the fair value of the convertible loans include time to maturity risk free interest rate straight debt discount rate probability to convert and expected timing of conversion refer to note 8 for additional information as the inputs used in developing the fair value for level 3 instruments are unobservable and require significant management estimate a change in these inputs could result in a significant change in the fair value measurement revenue recognition effective january 1 2017 the group early adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers and subsequent

applies asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures 147 asc 820 148 asc 820 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements asc 820 establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 151 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level 2 151 other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace level 3 151 unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity asc 820 describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities 1 market approach 2 income approach and 3 cost approach the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset the group 146 s financial instruments include accounts receivables accounts payable other receivables other payables and short term debt the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short term maturities the group elected the fair value option to account for its convertible loans the fair

flow and equity based on the premium conversion ratio of 25 respectively the convertible loans are classified as level 3 instruments as the valuation was determined based on unobservable inputs which

contained elsewhere in this prospectus and does not contain all of the information that you should consider in making your investment decision before investing in our common stock you should carefully read this entire prospectus including our financial statements and the related notes thereto and the information set forth in the sections titled risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless the context otherwise requires we use the terms annovis company we us and our in this prospectus to refer to annovis bio inc annovis bio inc annovis is a clinical stage drug platform company addressing neurodegeneration such as alzheimer s disease in down syndrome ad ds alzheimer s disease ad and parkinson s disease pd we have an ongoing phase 2a proof of concept study in ad patients and have planned to commence a second phase 2a study in pd patients we are developing our lead compound anvs 401 for chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as ad ds ad and pd in several studies anvs 401 inhibited the synthesis of neurotoxic proteins 151 app a b app tau phospho tau tau and a synuclein a syn 151 that are the main cause of neurodegeneration high levels of neurotoxic proteins lead to impaired axonal transport which is responsible for the communication between and within nerve cells when that communication is impaired the immune system is activated and attacks the nerve cells eventually killing them through our patented product platform we have shown in four mildly cognitive impaired mci patients that anvs 401 lowered the levels of these neurotoxic proteins and inflammatory factors in preclinical studies lower neurotoxic protein levels led to improved axonal transport reduced inflammation lower nerve cell death and improved function industry has encountered challenges in targeting specifically one or the other neurotoxic protein be it app tau or a syn indicating that one neurotoxic protein alone does not change the course of neurodegeneration our goal is to develop a disease modifying drug dmd for patients with neurodegeneration by leveraging our clinical and animal evidence in inhibiting at least the three most relevant neurotoxic proteins believe that we are the only company developing a clinical stage proof of concept drug for ad ds ad and pd that inhibits more than one neurotoxic protein and has a mechanism of action designed to restore nerve cell axonal and synaptic activity by improving axonal transport in the brain we expect to treat memory loss and dementia associated with ad ds and ad as well as body and brain function in pd believe that anvs 401 has the potential to be the first drug to interfere with the underlying mechanism of neurodegeneration anvs 401 is a small once a day orally administered brain penetrant inhibitor of neurotoxic proteins the biological activity of anvs 401 has been evaluated in 19 animal studies conducted in leading institutions such as the karolinska institute columbia university and harvard university we also conducted three clinical trials with 125 humans including two safety studies in 120 healthy volunteers and a proof of concept study in four mci patients with parexel an international clinical research organization in these studies we showed that anvs 401 was well tolerated and we saw promising clinical signals are presently conducting a phase 2a study in ad patients in collaboration with the alzheimer disease cooperative study adcs and plan to initiate a second phase 2a proof of concept study of anvs 401 in the first quarter of 2020 with 50 pd patients the ad study being conducted by adcs is expected to enroll a total of 24 persons at three dose levels plus placebo in a double blind placebo controlled fashion to date the study has enrolled and treated eight early to moderate ad patients in table of contents september 2019 the data safety monitoring board overseeing this study reviewed the safety data for the participants thus far and recommended the study continue without modification we have designed the two phase 2a studies with parexel by applying our understanding of the underlying disease states in neurodegeneration and by measuring not just target but also pathway validation in the spinal fluid of these patients this means that we are proposing to measure as many factors as possible associated with the toxic cascade precipitated by impaired axonal transport if we are able to show both target and pathway validation in two patient populations we believe that our opportunity for successful phase 3 studies is better than if we merely demonstrated target validation in one patient population believe that ad and pd are two of the largest medical needs of the aging u s population and two potentially large markets once a dmd has been developed and approved therefore we desire to demonstrate anvs 401 s efficacy in both indications however since ad studies are very large and time and capital consuming we plan to focus on an orphan population that is substantially similar to ad but in a very controlled and limited setting we intend to focus on ad in the ds population in ds the app gene is triplicated leading to early onset ad with similar pathology as sporadic ad in our animal studies in ds mice lowering their high levels of app improved axonal transport in the brain and increased memory and learning as described on page 6 in accordance with this animal data we expect that lowering levels of app tau and a syn in human patients will lead to an improvement in their memory cognition and dementia concluding the study in ad ds patients instead of ad patients will allow us to obtain human data for ad in an orphan subpopulation much faster than in the regular ad population concomitantly our goal is to also conduct a phase 3 pivotal study in early pd patients by the end of 2024 we expect to have conducted two pivotal studies for anvs 401 one in ad ds and one in pd and to have filed a new drug application nda with the u s food and drug administration fda our pipeline consists of anvs 401 for chronic neurodegeneration 151 including ad its orphan indication ad ds and pd anvs 405 to treat acute neurodegeneration 151 traumatic brain injury tbi and stroke 151 and anvs 301 for advanced ad our lead compound anvs 401 is an orally administered drug being developed for chronic indications such as ad ds ad and pd because in preclinical studies it improved axonal transport in these diseases by inhibiting the overproduction of neurotoxic proteins that kill nerve cells the compound was tested in three phase 1 clinical studies that showed it to be well tolerated this safety data is applicable to the clinical development of anvs 401 for ad ds ad pd and other chronic neurodegenerative disorders table of contents for acute indications we are developing anvs 405 focused on protecting the brain after tbi and or stroke anvs 405 is the same compound as anvs 401 but it is given intravenously in cases of acute head and brain trauma anvs 405 was given to rats as an injectable after tbi to ensure that it would reach the brain in less than 15 minutes rather than 1 5 hours tbi rats that were treated after the insult exhibited enhanced memory and learning and lowered microglia activation a measure of inflammation to date the program has been funded by a grant from the u s army and we plan to seek additional grant funding to further the development of anvs 405 for acute indications of brain and nerve trauma we are developing our compound anvs 301 to increase cognitive capability in later stages of ad and dementia in preclinical studies anvs 301 improved memory and learning in very old rats by lowering the number of errors from six to three and shortening run times from approximately 75 to approximately 28 seconds anvs 301 is in a phase 1 clinical trial that is being conducted and financed by the national institutes of health nih the single ascending dose study is nearly complete and we in collaboration with the nih are preparing to move into the multiple ascending dose study when the single and multiple ascending dose safety studies are complete we will review the data and decide whether to pursue the indication of advanced ad background 151 what is neurodegeneration a normal nerve cell receives signals processes them in the cell body and transports them through the axon a long arm nerve fiber that extends out from the cell body and connects to the synapses or fingers these fingers then touch the successive nerve cell s where the signals are relayed further nerve cell with axon and synapse table of contents brain cells become injured or stressed their first response is reduction and impairment of axonal transport if the insult persists axonal vesicle transport remains impaired resulting in decreased levels of neurotransmitters and leading to depression serotonin anxiety and insomnia gaba ad acetylcholine and pd dopamine it also results in lower levels of neurotrophic factors and in nerve cells getting sick when the immune system sees a sick cell it proceeds to remove it which leads to inflammation in the brain eventually the sick cell is then killed by the immune system anvs 401 151 our solution to reverse neurodegeneration anvs 401 is a small lipophilic molecule that is orally available and readily enters the brain as demonstrated by preclinical pharmacokinetics analyses showing brain concentrations approximately six to eight times higher than plasma concentrations anvs 401 showed a mechanism of action we believe to be unique in that it inhibited the over translation of and therefore reduced the levels of several key neurotoxic proteins both in vitro and in vivo including app tau and a syn three phase 1 clinical studies demonstrated that anvs 401 was well tolerated the third proof of concept study showed reduced levels of app tau and a syn in the cerebrospinal fluid csf of four mci patients additionally we now have preclinical data that linked lowering neurotoxic proteins to improvement of axonal transport and function by lowering the levels of neurotoxic proteins in two ad animal models 151 ad transgenic tg mice and ds trisomic mice 151 anvs 401 increased memory and learning anvs 401 also improved colonic motility in a pd tg mouse model of pd see page 6 date all approaches that have targeted only one neurotoxic protein have failed we believe anvs 401 is the only drug in development that targets multiple neurotoxic proteins targeting multiple neurotoxic proteins anvs 401 resembles a combination therapy approach with the added convenience of being a single drug with a single drug target therefore we have worked to understand how anvs 401 is able to inhibit the translation of more than one neurotoxic protein novel mechanism of action and target engagement we undertook an extensive exploration of the mechanism of action of anvs 401 on app and a syn synthesis and we concluded that anvs 401 specifically inhibits translation of mrnas coding for neurotoxic proteins only using five different methods we obtained overlapping results in vitro mrnas of neurotoxic proteins have a conserved stem loop in the 5 untranslated region 5 utr called an iron response element ire type ii stem loop these ires bind to an rna binding protein specifically to iron regulatory protein 1 irp1 when the mrnas are bound they are not translated when the iron levels in the cytoplasm go up irp1 releases its mrnas and they are translated table of contents in our studies we saw that the mechanism of action of our lead compound anvs 401 inhibited over expression of neurotoxic proteins by binding to the ire irp1 complex and preventing its opening thereby impeding the release of the mrnas and their translation axonal transport and pathway engagement when axonal transport and synaptic transmission are impaired the cell releases lower levels of neurotransmitters leading to neuropsychopharmacological disorders abnormal axonal transport also lowers levels of neurotrophic factors which are responsible for the health of nerve cells when the immune system sees a sick nerve cell it gets activated and attacks the nerve cell eventually killing it therefore impairment in axonal transport leads to inflammation and finally leads to nerve cell death through several studies discussed below we have found that by reducing app tau and a syn levels anvs 401 treatment improved axonal transport and impeded the toxic cascade which leads to nerve cell death table of contents pathway engagement studies showed that anvs 401 lowered levels of neurotoxic proteins and improved function ad tg mice 151 lowered levels of app and its fragments and improved memory learning and brain function the ad tg mice on placebo never learned to find their way in the 7 arm water maze with less than three to four mistakes whereas the anvs 401 treated mice found their way with one mistake ds trisomic mice 151 lowered levels of app and recovered their exploratory activity and number of entries into the maze the trisomic mice moved 38 less and made 63 more mistakes in the maze than healthy wild type mice anvs 401 increased activity and reduced mistakes of ds trisomic mice pd tg mice 151 lowered levels of a syn in the brain and regulated gut motility the pd tg mice at four months had four times slower and at seven months had seven times slower gut motility than healthy wild type mice anvs 401 improved colonic mci patients 151 in four patients lowered levels of app and tau statistically significantly a syn showed a downward trend studies showed that anvs 401 improved retrograde and anterograde axonal transport ds trisomic mice nerve cells 151 in studies conducted at ucsd inhibition of app levels led to restoration of anterograde and retrograde vesicle transport anvs 401 treatment of the ds nerve cells resulted in an increase in transport velocity of 70 anvs 401 also decreased the pause time by 29 this was measured in vitro in isolated fully differentiated ds nerve cells studies showed that anvs 401 increased synaptic transmission in ad tg mice 151 a columbia university study showed that the ad tg mice treated with anvs 401 had similar long term potentiation as healthy wild type mice whereas long term potentiation of the placebo treated ad tg mice was markedly reduced studies showed that anvs 401 increased levels of neurogenesis ad tg mice brains 151 two studies by the karolinska institute measured stem cell and nerve cell differentiation one study found that anvs 401 treatment increased stem cell differentiation into nerve cells by 40 in the hippocampus the second study showed that while the data was variable and dependent on age of the mice and area of the brain treatment with anvs 401 improved synaptic function by modulating the maturation and plasticity of newborn neurons studies showed that anvs 401 and or anvs 405 lowered inflammation in mci patients 151 in a proof of concept clinical trial four mci patients treated with anvs 401 showed a reduction in inflammatory factors tbi rats 151 rats with traumatic brain injury had much larger microglia than normal rats enlarged microglia means that the microglia is activated and shows inflammation tbi rats treated with anvs 405 had smaller microglia showing lower inflammation studies showed that anvs 405 protected nerve cells in tbi rats 151 a ucla study stained the rat substantia nigra with a fluorescent probe this probe th immunoreactivity binds to live cells while dead cells do not stain therefore the fluorescent signal is a surrogate marker for live cells rats were subjected to either tbi or to a sham i e mock surgery non tbi rats tbi rats treated with a placebo showed table of contents 40 less fluorescence than non tbi rats while tbi rats treated with anvs 405 showed fluorescence of 100 or more as compared to non tbi rats retina rats 151 in a hershey medical center unpublished study in which saline was injected into one eye to increase the pressure which mimics acute glaucoma and kills retinal cells anvs 405 protected 67 of the retina lowering levels of neurotoxic proteins anvs 401 and anvs 405 improved functions in all animal models we tested these functions are memory learning and long term potentiation in ad mice memory learning and axonal transport in ds mice gut and gait function in pd mice memory and learning in tbi rats and sight in acute glaucoma rats we believe these effects make anvs 401 a very promising drug for the treatment of memory loss and dementia in ad ds and ad and bodily and brain functions in pd our goal in our phase 2a studies in ad and pd patients is to demonstrate that anvs 401 is well tolerated and is able to lower the csf levels of neurotoxic proteins at least app tau and a syn and inflammatory markers as previously seen in clinical and preclinical studies in these studies we are also planning to analyze the csf levels for additional neurotoxic proteins control proteins lacking the conserved mrna sequence of neurotoxic proteins as well as neurotransmitters neurotrophic factors degeneration markers and cognitive outcomes thus we expect that we will be able to identify potential biomarkers for use in later studies plans for the two phase 2 studies in ad and pd patients our goal is to replicate the same target and pathway validation in our two phase 2a studies in ad and pd patients as we saw in preclinical studies in the spinal fluid of ad and pd patients we plan to show a decrease in levels of neurotoxic proteins and show the reversal of the toxic cascade once these two studies are fully analyzed we will be able to better understand the similarities and differences between early ad and pd patients as well as the effect of anvs 401 on all endpoints if the two studies are successful we expect to conduct phase 3 clinical studies in ad ds and pd date we have submitted our animal and human data to the fda as well as our plans for doing the two phase 2a studies in ad and pd patients the fda has raised no objections to our plans and protocols to date however the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results we have assembled a highly experienced management team board of directors and scientific advisory board to execute on our mission to develop disease modifying therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders our founder and chief executive officer maria maccecchini ph d is a business leader drug developer and neuroscientist with over 30 years of expertise in neurodegeneration our chief financial officer is jeffrey mcgroarty he has extensive experience as cfo of public companies our chief medical advisor jeffrey cummings m d is one of the most respected clinical alzheimer scientists he was previously director of neurology at the cleveland clinic our chief scientific advisor william mobley m d ph d is one of the most respected down syndrome and alzheimer s disease research scientists he serves as executive director of uc san diego s down syndrome center for research and treatment and holds the florence riford chair of alzheimer s disease research our chairman michael hoffman has extensive experience in investing in successful businesses as well as growing and leading companies scientific advisory board is composed of scientists known for their work in the area of neurodegeneration they provide us with advice and guidance on scientific and industry matters we believe our team with its deep scientific background drug development experience and industry table of contents positions us to become a leading company developing therapies for neurodegenerative disorders we do not have rules or procedures governing our scientific advisory board however the universities they are associated with may have rules regarding outside activities of faculty members our objectives are to develop and gain regulatory approval of anvs 401 for the treatment of ad ds which is an orphan indication of ad and to obtain regulatory approval of anvs 401 for pd and leverage our discovery platform to treat other neurodegenerative disorders key elements of our strategy are expect the funds we are raising in this offering to be sufficient to complete the following develop anvs 401 through two phase 2a clinical studies 151 one in ad and one in accelerate recruitment of the ongoing phase 2a study in ad patients run by adcs and complete the study within one year start the phase 2a pd trial in the united states and possibly internationally for the treatment of pd in the first quarter of 2020 we expect the study to be completed in one year fully analyze both studies in early 2021 prepare for a phase 3 pivotal study in ad ds commence the planning of the ad ds phase 3 study in collaboration with professor william mobley conduct chronic toxicology studies in rats and dogs 151 in order to test a drug in humans for extended lengths of time it must first be tested for safety for six months in rats and nine months in dogs in september 2019 we received a notice of award for a 1 7 million grant from the national institute on aging which is expected to fully cover the costs of these studies presently we have one month of safety studies in mice rats and dogs which allows us to test anvs 401 for one month in humans manufacture adequate quantities of anvs 401 to conduct the phase 2a study in pd patients as well as phase 3 studies in ad ds and early pd patients pursue and obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology inventions improvements platforms and our product continue to file three families of patent applications to prolong the life of anvs 401 in august 2019 the u s patent and trademark office granted patent no us 10 383 851 the first of our patents from this family covering pd and associated diseases conduct a follow on study in anvs 405 seek a second grant from the us army evaluate the effect anvs 405 administered to tbi rats at various intervals post injury to determine how long after a tbi we can effectively treat a patient continue development of anvs 301 complete single ascending dose study and move into multiple ascending dose study seek additional funding from the nih table of contents completion of a future subsequent financing we intend to undertake the following the end of the two phase 2a studies we will evaluate the data discuss the animal toxicology and the two studies with the fda and move to one phase 3 in ad ds and one in early pd patients conduct a phase 3 study in ad ds an orphan indication that follows the course of ad including memory loss and dementia in a well characterized genetic predisposed group of people conduct a phase 3 study in early pd patients who show symptoms of pd but are not taking l dopa or agonist the successful conduct of the two phase 3 studies we intend to commercialize anvs 401 in collaboration with one or more pharmaceutical companies to commercialize anvs 401 when approved we intend to establish one or more marketing collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies we expect to seek separate development and commercialization collaborators in japan and other parts of asia evaluate the development of anvs 401 for other pd populations after our initial focus on early pd we plan to test anvs 401 in advanced pd as well as a prophylaxis for pd evaluate anvs 401 for early ad populations conduct a phase 3 study in early ad evaluate the development of anvs 401 for other ad populations after our initial focus on early ad we plan to test anvs 401 in advanced ad as well as a prophylaxis for ad evaluate anvs 401 in other neurodegenerative disorders summary of risks associated with our business our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including those highlighted in the section titled risk factors immediately following this prospectus summary some of these risks are we have incurred significant net losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability even if this offering is successful we will require additional capital to fund our operations and if we fail to obtain necessary funding we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of anvs 401 our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we are heavily dependent on the success of anvs 401 our lead product candidate which is still under clinical development and if it does not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized our business may be harmed we have concentrated our research and development efforts on the treatment of ad and pd two diseases that have seen limited success in drug clinical trials are expensive time consuming difficult to design and implement and involve an uncertain outcome results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later trials if we are unable to obtain maintain and defend patent protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad we may not be able to compete effectively in our target markets table of contents our corporate information we were incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in 2008 our

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this prospectus before making an investment in our common stock our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected if any of these risks occurs and as a result the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment risks related to our financial position and need for additional capital we have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future we are not currently profitable and we may never achieve or sustain profitability we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and have incurred losses since our formation we incurred net losses of 0 7 million for each of the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 and 0 8 million and 0 5 million for the nine month periods ended september 30 2019 and 2018 respectively as of september 30 2019 we had an accumulated deficit of 8 6 million we have not commercialized any products and have never generated revenue from the commercialization of any product to date we have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development including our preclinical and clinical work and to intellectual property expect to incur significant additional operating losses for the next several years at least as we advance anvs 401 and any other product candidate through clinical development complete clinical trials seek regulatory approval and commercialize the drug or any other product candidate if approved the costs of advancing product candidates into each clinical phase tend to increase substantially over the duration of the clinical development process therefore the total costs to advance any of our product candidates to marketing approval in even a single jurisdiction will be substantial because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to begin generating revenue from the commercialization of any products or achieve or maintain profitability our expenses will also increase substantially if and as commence our two phase 3 trials in ad ds and in early pd or conduct clinical trials for any other product candidates are required by the fda to complete two phase 3 trials to support a nda for anvs 401 in ad ds or in pd establish a sales marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize our drug if approved and for any other product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval maintain expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio hire additional clinical scientific and commercial personnel add operational financial and management information systems and personnel including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts as well as to support our transition to a public reporting company and acquire or in license or invent other product candidates or technologies our ability to successfully develop commercialize and license any product candidates and generate product revenue is subject to substantial additional risks and uncertainties as described under 151 risks related to development clinical testing manufacturing and regulatory approval and 151 risks related to commercialization as a result we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future these net losses and negative cash flows have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital the amount of table of contents future net losses will depend in part on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues if we are unable to develop and commercialize one or more product candidates either alone or through collaborations or if revenues from any product that receives marketing approval are insufficient we will not achieve profitability even if we do achieve profitability we may not be able to sustain profitability or meet outside expectations for our profitability if we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability or to meet outside expectations for our profitability the value of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected even if this offering is successful we will require additional capital to fund our operations and if we fail to obtain necessary financing we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of anvs 401 our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the clinical development of anvs 401 and launch and commercialize anvs 401 if we receive regulatory approval we will require additional capital for the further development and potential commercialization of anvs 401 and may also need to raise additional funds sooner to pursue a more accelerated development of anvs 401 if we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms we could be forced to delay reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts believe that the net proceeds from this offering together with our existing cash and cash equivalents as of september 30 2019 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 18 months we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could deploy our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect our future funding requirements both near and long term will depend on many factors including but not limited to the initiation progress timing costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials including patient enrollment in such trials for anvs 401 or any other future product candidates clinical development plans we establish for anvs 401 and any other future product candidates obligation to make royalty and non royalty sublicense receipt payments to third party licensors if any under our licensing agreements number and characteristics of product candidates that we discover or in license and develop outcome timing and cost of regulatory review by the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities including the potential for the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect costs of filing prosecuting defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing other intellectual property rights effects of competing technological and market developments costs and timing of the implementation of commercial scale manufacturing activities and costs and timing of establishing sales marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities due to a lack of capital our ability to become profitable will be compromised table of contents we as well as our independent registered public accounting firm have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018 with respect to this uncertainty our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to obtain additional funding we believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current operating plans through at least the next 18 months we have based these estimates however on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect and need to raise additional funds sooner than we anticipate if we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms we would be forced to delay reduce or eliminate our research and development programs and commercialization efforts raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders including purchasers of common stock in this offering restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates until such time if ever as we can generate substantial revenue we may finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings debt financings marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or other sources we do not currently have any committed external source of funds in addition we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder debt financing and preferred equity financing if available may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends if we raise additional funds through collaborations strategic alliances or marketing distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies intellectual property future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us if we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed we may be required to delay limit reduce or terminate product candidate development or future commercialization efforts we have a limited operating history and no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability we were established and began operations in 2008 our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company licensing product candidates conducting preclinical and clinical studies of anvs 401 for treatment of ad ds ad and pd and for understanding its mechanism of action and its capability of stopping the toxic cascade that leads to nerve cell death we have further tested anvs 401 in clinical trials for safety and proof of concept we have not yet demonstrated the ability to successfully complete a large scale pivotal clinical trial obtain marketing approval manufacture a commercial scale product arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization consequently predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products table of contents addition as a business with a limited operating history we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other known and unknown factors we will eventually need to transition from a company with a research focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities we may not be successful in such a transition and as a result our business may be adversely affected we continue to build our business we expect our financial condition and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly you should not rely upon the results of any particular quarterly or annual period as indications of future operating performance our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations as of september 30 2019 we had net operating loss carryforwards or nols of 4 1 million for federal income tax purposes and 4 1 million for state income tax purposes which may be available to offset our future taxable income if any and begin to expire in various amounts in 2028 nols of 1 4 million generated after december 31 2017 are not subject to expiration but are limited to 80 of taxable income in future years for federal income tax purposes in general under section 382 of the u s internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre change nols to offset future taxable income due to previous ownership changes or if we undergo an ownership change in connection with or after this offering our ability to use our nols could be limited by section 382 of the code future changes in our stock ownership some of which are outside of our control could result in an ownership change under section 382 of the code furthermore our ability to use nols of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations for these reasons we may not be able to use a material portion of the nols even if we attain profitability risks related to development clinical testing manufacturing and regulatory approval we are heavily dependent on the success of anvs 401 our most advanced product candidate which is still under clinical development and if this drug does not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized our business may be harmed we do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval currently our lead clinical stage product candidate is anvs 401 as a result our business is dependent on our ability to successfully complete clinical development of obtain regulatory approval for and if approved successfully commercialize anvs 401 in a timely manner we cannot commercialize anvs 401 in the united states without first obtaining regulatory approval from the fda similarly we cannot commercialize anvs 401 outside of the united states without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of anvs 401 for a target indication we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical studies and clinical trials generally including two adequate and well controlled clinical trials and with respect to approval in the united states to the satisfaction of the fda that anvs 401 is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities processes and controls are adequate even if anvs 401 were to successfully obtain approval from the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups warnings precautions or contraindications or may be subject to burdensome post approval study or risk management requirements if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for anvs 401 in one or more jurisdictions or any approval contains significant limitations we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of any other product candidate that we may in license develop or acquire in the future furthermore even if we obtain regulatory approval for anvs 401 we will still need to table of contents commercial organization establish commercially viable pricing and obtain approval for adequate reimbursement from third party and government payors if we are unable to successfully commercialize anvs 401 we may not be able to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business clinical trials are expensive time consuming and difficult to design and implement and involve an uncertain clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process because the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results anvs 401 and our other compounds may not have favorable results in later preclinical and clinical studies or receive regulatory approval we may experience delays in initiating and completing any clinical trials that we intend to conduct and we do not know whether planned clinical trials including our phase 2a trial for pd will begin on time need to be redesigned enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule or at all clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons including delays related to the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical studies obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial reaching an agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations or cros and clinical trial sites the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different cros and trial sites obtaining institutional review board or irb approval at each site or independent ethics committee or iec approval at sites outside the recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial in a timely manner and in sufficient numbers having patients complete a trial or return for post treatment follow up imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory authorities including as a result of unforeseen safety issues or side effects or failure of trial sites to adhere to regulatory requirements or follow trial protocols clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial addressing patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial adding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites or manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us the irbs or iecs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted the data safety monitoring board or dsmb for such trial or the fda or other regulatory authorities such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial furthermore we rely on cros and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and while we have agreements governing their committed activities we have limited influence over their actual performance as described in 151 risks related to our dependence on third table of contents the regulatory approval processes of the fda and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy time consuming and inherently unpredictable and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for anvs 401 or any other product candidates our business will be substantially harmed the time required to obtain approval by the fda and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities in addition approval policies regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions we have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that we will never obtain regulatory approval for anvs 401 or any other product candidate we are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the united states until we receive regulatory approval of a nda from the fda we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication serious and unexpected drug related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates or other products containing the active ingredient in our product candidates negative or ambiguous results from our clinical trials or results that may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be acceptable or sufficient to support the submission of an nda or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the united states or elsewhere and we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials the fda or comparable foreign authorities may disagree regarding the formulation labeling and or the specifications of our product candidates the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or find deficiencies with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies and the approval policies or regulations of the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the united states or abroad we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials and to the satisfaction of the fda or foreign regulatory agencies that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities for diseases like ad ds ad and pd the fda has stated that one single phase 3 trial is adequate for approval if it demonstrates robust and unquestionable efficacy however the circumstances under which a single adequate and controlled study can be used as the sole basis of demonstrating efficacy of a drug are exceptional table of contents fda or any foreign regulatory bodies can delay limit or deny approval of our product candidates or require us to conduct additional preclinical or clinical testing or abandon a program for many reasons including the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our safety interpretation of our drug the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our efficacy interpretation of our drug the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may regard our cmc package as inadequate the large number of drugs in development only a small percentage successfully complete the regulatory approval processes and are commercialized this lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market anvs 401 or another product candidate which would significantly harm our business results of operations and prospects addition the fda or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population than we originally requested and the fda or applicable foreign regulatory agency may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates we have concentrated our research and development efforts on the treatment of ad and pd diseases that have seen limited success in drug development further anvs 401 is based on a new approach to treating ad and pd which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and subsequent obtaining of regulatory approval efforts by biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies in treating ad and pd have seen limited success in drug development and there are no fda approved disease modifying therapeutic options available for patients with ad and pd we cannot be certain that our approach will lead to the development of approvable or marketable products the only drugs approved by the fda to treat ad and pd to date address the disease s symptoms no new treatments have been approved for ad since 2003 since 2003 over 500 clinical studies have been completed and no compound has shown efficacy ad drug candidates have the highest failure rate of 100 compared to 50 to 80 for all other drug candidates as a result the fda has a limited set of products to rely on in evaluating anvs 401 this could result in a longer than expected regulatory review process increased expected development costs or the delay or prevention of commercialization of anvs 401 for the treatment of ad and pd enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside our control the timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends among other things on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion we may encounter delays in enrolling or be unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials and even once enrolled we may be unable to retain a table of contents number of patients to complete any of our trials patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors including the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial s primary endpoints the nature of the trial protocol the existing body of safety and efficacy data with respect to the product candidate the proximity of patients to clinical sites our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience clinicians and patients perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating competing clinical trials being conducted by other companies or institutions our ability to maintain patient consents and the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion results of preclinical studies early clinical trials or analyses may not be indicative of results obtained in later trials the results of preclinical studies early clinical trials or analyses of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later stage clinical trials product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials in addition conclusions based on promising data from analyses of clinical results may be shown to be incorrect when implemented in prospective clinical trials even if our clinical trials for anvs 401 are completed as planned we cannot be certain that their results will support the safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain regulatory interim top line and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data from time to time we may publish interim top line or preliminary data from our clinical studies interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available preliminary or top line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published as a result interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business table of contents our product candidates may cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval or if approved require them to be taken off the market require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales serious adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by anvs 401 or any other product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the fda or other comparable foreign authorities results of any clinical trial we conduct could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics patients treated with anvs 401 to date at high doses have experienced adverse events that include nausea and vomiting unacceptable side effects arise in the development of our product candidates we the fda or the irbs at the institutions in which our studies are conducted or the dsmb if constituted for our clinical trials could recommend a suspension or termination of our clinical trials or the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of a product candidate for any or all targeted indications in addition drug related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete a trial or result in potential product liability claims in addition these side effects may not be appropriately recognized or managed by the treating medical staff we expect to have to train medical personnel using our product candidates to understand the side effect profiles for our clinical trials and upon any commercialization of any of our product candidates inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our product candidates could result in patient injury or death any of these occurrences may harm our business financial condition and prospects significantly if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result including regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label such as a black box warning or contraindication additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof we may be required to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or rems or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients the product may become less competitive and our reputation may suffer of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of a product candidate if approved and could significantly harm our business results of operations the market opportunities for anvs 401 if approved may be smaller than we anticipate we expect to initially seek approval for anvs 401 for ad ds ad and pd in the us our estimates of market potential have been derived from a variety of sources including scientific literature patient foundations and market research and may prove to be incorrect even if we obtain significant market share for any product candidate if approved if the potential target populations are small we may never achieve profitability without obtaining marketing approval for additional indications table of contents we have never obtained marketing approval for a product candidate and we may be unable to obtain or may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates we have never obtained marketing approval for a product candidate it is possible that the fda may refuse to accept for substantive review any ndas that we submit for our product candidates or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates if the fda does not accept or approve our ndas for our product candidates it may require that we conduct additional clinical preclinical or manufacturing validation studies and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications depending on the extent of these or any other fda required studies approval of any nda that we submit may be delayed or may require us to expend more resources than we have available it is also possible that additional studies if performed and completed may not be considered sufficient by the fda to approve our ndas delay in obtaining or an inability to obtain marketing approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability if any of these outcomes occur we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for our product candidates which could significantly harm our business even if we obtain fda approval for anvs 401 or any other product candidate in the united states we may never obtain approval for or commercialize anvs 401 or any other product candidate in any other jurisdiction which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential in order to market any products in any particular jurisdiction we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country by country basis regarding safety and efficacy approval by the fda in the united states does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions however the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere in addition clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and increased costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction including in international markets and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of any product we develop will be unrealized even if we obtain regulatory approval for anvs 401 or any product candidate we will still face extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements and obligations and any product candidates if approved may face future development and regulatory difficulties any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval along with the manufacturing processes post approval clinical data labeling packaging distribution adverse event reporting storage recordkeeping export import advertising and promotional activities for such product among other things will be subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the fda and other regulatory authorities these requirements include submissions of safety and other post marketing information and reports establishment registration and drug listing requirements continued compliance with current good manufacturing practice or cgmp requirements relating to manufacturing quality control quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents requirements table of contents the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping and good clinical practice or gcp requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post approval if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval including a requirement to implement a rems if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval the accompanying label may limit the approved indicated use of the product candidate which could limit sales of the product candidate the fda may also impose requirements for costly post marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product the fda closely regulates the post approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling the fda imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off label use and if we market our products for uses beyond their approved indications we may be subject to enforcement action for off label marketing violations of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or fdca relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to fda enforcement actions and investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws addition later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products manufacturers or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may yield various results including restrictions on manufacturing such products restrictions on the labeling or marketing of products restrictions on product distribution or use requirements to conduct post marketing studies or clinical trials warning letters or untitled letters withdrawal of the products from the market refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit recall of products fines restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals refusal to permit the import or export of our products product seizure or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the fda s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained which would adversely affect our business prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability table of contents we also cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action either in the united states or abroad for example certain policies of the current presidential administration may impact our business and industry namely the current presidential administration has taken several executive actions including the issuance of a number of executive orders that could impose significant burdens on or otherwise materially delay the fda s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking issuance of guidance and review and approval of marketing applications it is difficult to predict how these executive actions will be implemented and the extent to which they will impact the fda s ability to exercise its regulatory authority if these executive actions impose constraints on fda s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course our business may be negatively impacted we may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for anvs 401 from the fda at the end of the two phase 2a studies in ad and pd respectively however we might not receive such designation and even if we do such designation may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process we may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for anvs 401 or one or more of our other product candidates a breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development for drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies interaction and communication between the fda and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the fda may also be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time the nda is submitted to the fda as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the fda accordingly even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy the fda may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation even if we receive breakthrough therapy designation the receipt of such designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development or regulatory review or approval process compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional fda procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the fda in addition even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies the fda may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for fda review or approval will not be shortened potential product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop the use of anvs 401 or any other product candidates we may develop in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims product liability claims might be brought against us by patients healthcare providers pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products on occasion large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects if we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims we could incur substantial liability and costs in addition regardless of merit or eventual outcome product liability claims may result impairment of our business reputation and significant negative media attention withdrawal of participants from our clinical trials significant costs to defend the litigation table of contents distraction of management s attention from our primary business substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants inability to commercialize anvs 401 or any other product candidate product recalls withdrawals or labeling marketing or promotional restrictions decreased market demand for any product and loss of revenue product liability insurance coverage we acquire in the future may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer in connection with our phase 1 clinical studies we carried insurance for product liability claims in the united states we intend to acquire insurance coverage to include larger clinical studies different countries and sale of commercial products however we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our share price to decline and if judgments exceed our insurance coverage could adversely affect the results of our operations and business including preventing or limiting the commercialization of any product candidates we develop risks related to commercialization we face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change our success is highly dependent on our ability to acquire develop and obtain marketing approval for new products on a cost effective basis and to market them successfully if anvs 401 is approved we will face intense competition from a variety of businesses including large fully integrated pharmaceutical companies specialty pharmaceutical companies and biopharmaceutical companies in the united states and other jurisdictions these organizations may have significantly greater resources than we do and may conduct similar research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research development manufacturing and marketing of products that may compete with us competitors may among other things have significantly greater name recognition financial manufacturing marketing drug development technical and human resources than we do and future mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective less expensive more convenient or easier to administer or have fewer or less severe effects obtain quicker regulatory approval implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing or form more advantageous strategic alliances and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration and in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop table of contents commercialize products that are more effective have fewer or less severe side effects or are more convenient or are less expensive than anvs 401 our competitors may also obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for anvs 401 which could result in our competitors establishing or strengthening their market position before we are able to enter the market the successful commercialization of anvs 401 and any other product candidate we develop will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities and health insurers establish adequate coverage reimbursement levels and pricing policies failure to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates if approved could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid private health insurers and other third party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford prescription medications such as anvs 401 if approved our ability to achieve acceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement for products by governmental authorities private health insurers and other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our drug and any other product candidates we develop assuming we obtain coverage for our product candidates by a third party payor the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co payments that patients find unacceptably high we cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the united states or elsewhere will be available for our product candidates or any product that we may develop and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services and many third party payors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement for particular drugs or biologics when an equivalent generic drug biosimilar or a less expensive therapy is available it is possible that a third party payor may consider our product candidates as substitutable and offer to reimburse patients only for the less expensive product even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our product candidates pricing of existing drugs may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our product candidates these payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in our product candidates if reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our product candidates is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products in the united states third party payors including private and governmental payors such as the medicare and medicaid programs play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered the medicare and medicaid programs increasingly are used as models in the united states for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics some third party payors may require pre approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies it is difficult to predict at this time what third party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third party payors in the united states therefore coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor as a result the coverage determination process is often a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance furthermore rules and regulations regarding table of contents change frequently in some cases at short notice and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely may also be subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations outside of the united states and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in other countries have and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of medical products in many countries the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products but monitor and control company profits foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates accordingly in markets outside the united states the reimbursement for our product candidates may be reduced compared with the united states and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits increasing efforts by governmental and third party payors in the united states to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and as a result they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed health care the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general particularly prescription drugs and biologics and surgical procedures and other treatments has become intense as a result increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products even if anvs 401 or any product candidate we develop receives marketing approval it may fail to achieve market acceptance by physicians patients third party payors or others in the medical community necessary for commercial success if anvs 401 or any product candidate we develop receives marketing approval it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians patients third party payors and others in the medical community if it does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance we may not generate significant product revenues or become profitable the degree of market acceptance of our product candidates if approved will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments including any similar generic treatments our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies the strength of marketing and distribution support the availability of third party coverage and adequate reimbursement the prevalence and severity of any side effects and any restrictions on the use of our product together with other medications table of contents we expect sales of our product candidates if approved to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future the failure of our product candidates to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing if we are unable to establish sales marketing and distribution capabilities either on our own or in collaboration with third parties we may not be successful in commercializing anvs 401 if approved we do not have any infrastructure for the sales marketing or distribution of anvs 401 and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost effectiveness of doing so in order to market and successfully commercialize our drug or any product candidate we develop if approved we must build our sales distribution marketing managerial and other non technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services we expect to build a focused sales distribution and marketing infrastructure to market anvs 401 if approved in the united states and europe there are significant expenses and risks involved with establishing our own sales marketing and distribution capabilities including our ability to hire retain and appropriately incentivize qualified individuals generate sufficient sales leads provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales marketing and distribution capabilities could delay any product launch which would adversely impact the commercialization of that product for example if the commercial launch of anvs 401 for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses this may be costly and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates on our own include our inability to recruit train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or attain adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products and unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our product candidates if approved in certain markets overseas therefore our future success will depend in part on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities the collaborator s strategic interest in a product and such collaborator s ability to successfully market and sell the product we intend to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sale and marketing of anvs 401 if approved for certain markets overseas however we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements or if able to do so that they will have effective sales forces to the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be we are unable to build our own sales force or negotiate a collaborative relationship for the commercialization of anvs 401 we may be forced to delay the potential commercialization of the drug or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities if we need to increase our expenditures to fund commercialization activities for anvs 401 we will need to obtain additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may also have to enter into collaborative arrangements for anvs 401 at an earlier stage than otherwise would be ideal and we may be required to relinquish rights to it or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our business operating results and prospects table of contents we are unable to establish adequate sales marketing and distribution capabilities either on our own or in collaboration with third parties we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates and may never become profitable we will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies a variety of risks associated with operating internationally could materially adversely affect our business we currently have no international operations but our business strategy includes potentially expanding internationally if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval doing business internationally involves a number of risks including but not limited to multiple conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations tax laws export and import restrictions employment laws regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals permits and licenses failure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries additional potentially relevant third party patent rights complexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations complexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes government payors or patient self pay systems limits in our ability to penetrate international markets financial risks such as longer payment cycles difficulty collecting accounts receivable the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations natural disasters political and economic instability including wars terrorism and political unrest outbreak of disease boycotts curtailment of trade and other business restrictions certain expenses including among others expenses for travel translation and insurance and regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and activities that may fall within the purview of the u s foreign corrupt practices act its books and records provisions or its anti bribery provisions of these factors could significantly harm any future international expansion and operations and consequently our results of operations risks related to our dependence on third parties our employees and independent contractors including principal investigators cros consultants vendors and any third parties we may engage in connection with development and commercialization may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements which could have a material adverse effect on our business our employees and independent contractors including principal investigators consultants vendors and any third parties we may engage in connection with development and commercialization of our product candidates could engage in misconduct including intentional reckless or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the fda or other similar regulatory table of contents of other authorities including those laws that require the reporting of true complete and accurate information to such authorities manufacturing standards data privacy security fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations or laws that require the reporting of true complete and accurate financial information and data specifically sales marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud misconduct kickbacks self dealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion sales commission customer incentive programs and other business arrangements activities subject to these laws could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials creation of fraudulent data in preclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal misappropriation of drug product which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations additionally we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct even if none occurred if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations including the imposition of significant civil criminal and administrative penalties damages monetary fines disgorgements possible exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid other u s federal healthcare programs or healthcare programs in other jurisdictions individual imprisonment other sanctions contractual damages reputational harm diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations we currently rely on third party contract manufacturing organizations or cmos for the production of clinical supply of anvs 401 and intend to rely on cmos for the production of commercial supply of anvs 401 if approved our dependence on cmos may impair the development and commercialization of the drug which would adversely impact our business and financial position we have limited personnel with experience in manufacturing and we do not own facilities for manufacturing instead we rely on and expect to continue to rely on cmos for the supply of cgmp grade clinical trial materials and commercial quantities of anvs 401 and any product candidates we develop if approved reliance on cmos may expose us to more risk than if we were to manufacture our product candidates ourselves we intend to have manufactured a sufficient clinical supply of anvs 401 drug substance to enable us to complete our clinical trials and we have also engaged a cmo to provide clinical and commercial supply of the drug product facilities used to manufacture our product candidates must be inspected by the fda and comparable foreign authorities while we provide oversight of manufacturing activities we do not and will not control the execution of manufacturing activities by and are or will be essentially dependent on our cmos for compliance with cgmp requirements for the manufacture of our product candidates as a result we are subject to the risk that our product candidates may have manufacturing defects that we have limited ability to prevent if a cmo cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the regulatory requirements we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for the use of our product candidates in clinical trials or for commercial distribution of our product candidates if approved in addition we have limited control over the ability of our cmos to maintain adequate quality control quality assurance and qualified personnel if the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authority finds deficiencies with or does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval or finds deficiencies in the future we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities which would delay our development program and significantly impact our ability to develop obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates if approved in addition any failure to achieve and maintain compliance with table of contents laws regulations and standards could subject us to the risk that we may have to suspend the manufacture of our product candidates or that obtained approvals could be revoked furthermore cmos may breach existing agreements they have with us because of factors beyond our control they may also terminate or refuse to renew their agreement at a time that is costly or otherwise inconvenient for us if we were unable to find an adequate cmo or another acceptable solution in time our clinical trials could be delayed or our commercial activities could be harmed rely on and will continue to rely on cmos to purchase from third party suppliers the raw materials necessary to produce our product candidates we do not and will not have control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our cmos moreover we currently do not have any agreements for the production of these raw materials supplies of raw material could be interrupted from time to time and we cannot be certain that alternative supplies could be obtained within a reasonable timeframe at an acceptable cost or at all in addition a disruption in the supply of raw materials could delay the commercial launch of our product candidates if approved or result in a shortage in supply which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates growth in the costs and expenses of raw materials may also impair our ability to cost effectively manufacture our product candidates there are a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials that we may use to manufacture our product candidates and we may need to assess alternative suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of our product candidates new cmos or third party suppliers involves additional cost and requires our management s time and focus in addition there is typically a transition period when a new cmo commences work although we generally have not and do not intend to begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have on hand or will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of our product candidates to complete the clinical trial any significant delay in the supply of our product candidates or the raw materials needed to produce our product candidates could considerably delay conducting our clinical trials and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates part of their manufacture of our product candidates our cmos and third party suppliers are expected to comply with and respect the proprietary rights of others if a cmo or third party supplier fails to acquire the proper licenses or otherwise infringes the proprietary rights of others in the course of providing services to us we may have to find alternative cmos or third party suppliers or defend against claims of infringement either of which would significantly impact our ability to develop obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates if approved we intend to rely on third parties to conduct supervise and monitor our clinical trials if those third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or if they perform in an unsatisfactory manner it may harm our business we rely and will continue to rely on cros cro contracted vendors and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials including our two phase 2 trials of anvs 401 our reliance on cros for clinical development activities limits our control over these activities but we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal regulatory and scientific standards and our cros will be required to comply with the good laboratory practice requirements for our preclinical studies and gcp requirements for our clinical trials which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the fda and are also required by comparable foreign regulatory authorities regulatory authorities enforce gcp requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors principal investigators and clinical trial sites if we or our cros fail to comply with gcp requirements the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications we cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority such table of contents authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with gcp requirements in addition our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cgmp requirements accordingly if our cros fail to comply with these requirements we may be required to repeat clinical trials which would delay the regulatory approval process cros are not our employees and we do not control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical trials our cros may also have relationships with other commercial entities including our competitors for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position we face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by cros which may reduce our trade secret protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology if our cros do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations fail to meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reason our clinical trials may be extended delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize any product candidate that we develop as a result our financial results and the commercial prospects for any product candidate that we develop would be harmed our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed our relationship with any cros terminate we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative cros or do so on commercially reasonable terms switching or adding additional cros involves substantial cost and requires management s time and focus in addition there is a natural transition period when a new cro commences work as a result delays occur which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our cros there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and prospects the number and type of our collaborations could adversely affect our attractiveness to future collaborators or acquirers and the loss of or a disruption in our relationship with any one or more collaborators could harm our business any collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us we may not receive any future research and development funding or milestone or royalty payments under such collaborations if we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop additional product candidates all of the risks relating to product development regulatory approval and commercialization described in this prospectus also apply to the activities of any collaborators and there can be no assurance that our collaborations will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all addition subject to its contractual obligations to us if one of our collaborators is involved in a business combination or otherwise changes its business priorities the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of our product candidates if a collaborator terminates its agreement with us we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and the perception of our business and our stock price could be adversely affected table of contents we may in the future collaborate with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of therapeutic products we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend among other things upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors if we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis on acceptable terms or at all we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense if we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all if we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our programs and our business may be materially and adversely affected risks related to healthcare laws and other legal compliance matters enacted and future healthcare legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates if approved and may affect the prices we may set in the united states and other jurisdictions there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations in particular there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the u s federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare for example in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act or collectively the aca was enacted which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers among the provisions of the aca those of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries include the following an annual non deductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents other than those designated as orphan drugs which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs a new medicare part d coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to offer point of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under medicare part d new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals including reporting transfers of value made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers and reporting investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the medicaid drug rebate program a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program are calculated for drugs and biologics that are inhaled infused instilled implanted or injected table of contents extension of a manufacturer s medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in medicaid managed care expansion of eligibility criteria for medicaid programs thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer s medicaid rebate liability a new patient centered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research establishment of a center for medicare innovation at the centers for medicare amp medicaid services or cms to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower medicare and medicaid spending potentially including prescription drug spending expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the public health service program and a licensure framework for follow on biologic products its enactment there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future the current presidential administration and congress will likely continue to seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the aca this includes enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act which among other things removes penalties for not complying with the aca s individual mandate to carry health insurance it is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the aca was enacted for example the budget control act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions of medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year these reductions went into effect in april 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by congress in january 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several types of providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years additionally the orphan drug tax credit was reduced as part of a broader tax reform these new laws or any other similar laws introduced in the future may result in additional reductions in medicare and other health care funding which could negatively affect our customers and accordingly our financial operations addition there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the united states with respect to specialty drug pricing practices specifically there have been congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to bring more transparency to drug pricing reduce the cost of prescription drugs under medicare review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs moreover payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives we expect that additional u s federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that the u s federal government will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures states in the united states have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third party payors or other restrictions could harm our business table of contents financial condition and prospects in addition regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs this could reduce the ultimate demand for our product candidates or put pressure on our product pricing markets outside of the united states reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies we cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the united states or any other jurisdiction if we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance our product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability our business operations and current and future relationships with investigators healthcare professionals consultants third party payors patient organizations and customers will be subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws which could expose us to penalties our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators healthcare professionals consultants third party payors patient organizations and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations these laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations including how we research market sell and distribute our product candidates if approved such laws the u s federal anti kickback statute which prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting offering receiving or providing any remuneration including any kickback bribe or certain rebate directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind to induce or reward or in return for either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under u s federal and state healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the u s federal anti kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand the u s federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws including the civil false claims act or fca which among other things impose criminal and civil penalties including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to the u s federal government claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the u s federal government in addition the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the u s federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the fca a claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the federal government in addition manufacturers can be held liable under the fca even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims the u s federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa which imposes criminal and civil liability for among other things knowingly and willfully executing or table of contents to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses representations or promises any of the money or property owned by or under the custody or control of any healthcare benefit program regardless of the payor e g public or private and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services similar to the u s federal anti kickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 or hitech and their respective implementing regulations which impose among other things specified requirements relating to the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by covered entities subject to the rule such as health plans healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information hitech also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties amended hipaa to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal hipaa laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions the fdca which prohibits among other things the adulteration or misbranding of drugs biologics and medical devices the u s federal legislation commonly referred to as the physician payments sunshine act enacted as part of the aca and its implementing regulations which requires certain manufacturers of drugs devices biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under medicare medicaid or the children s health insurance program to report annually to the government information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and analogous u s state laws and regulations including state anti kickback and false claims laws which may apply to our business practices including but not limited to research distribution sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third party payor including private insurers state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the u s federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa thus complicating compliance efforts of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws it is possible that some of our business activities including our consulting agreements and other relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers some of whom receive stock or stock options as compensation for their services could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws ensuring that our current and future internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices table of contents not comply with current or future statutes regulations agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us we may be subject to the imposition of civil criminal and administrative penalties damages disgorgement monetary fines possible exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs individual imprisonment contractual damages reputational harm diminished profits and future earnings additional reporting requirements or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non compliance with these laws and curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations if any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws they may be subject to criminal civil or administrative sanctions including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment which could affect our ability to operate our business further defending against any such actions can be costly time consuming and may require significant personnel resources therefore even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us our business may be impaired any clinical trial programs we conduct or research collaborations we enter into in the european economic area may subject us to the general data protection regulation if we conduct clinical trial programs or enter into research collaborations in the european economic area we may be subject to the general data protection regulation or gdpr the gdpr applies extraterritorially and implements stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including for example high standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data robust disclosures to individuals a comprehensive individual data rights regime data export restrictions governing transfers of data from the european union or eu to other jurisdictions short timelines for data breach notifications limitations on retention of information increased requirements pertaining to health data other special categories of personal data and coded data and additional obligations if we contract third party processors in connection with the processing of personal data the gdpr provides that eu member states may establish their own laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data including genetic biometric or health data which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase if our or our partners or service providers privacy or data security measures fail to comply with the gdpr requirements we may be subject to litigation regulatory investigations enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and or fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher as well as compensation claims by affected individuals negative publicity reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations and we may become exposed to liability and substantial expenses in connection with environmental compliance or remediation activities our operations including our development testing and manufacturing activities are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern among other things the controlled use handling release and disposal of and the maintenance of a registry for hazardous materials and biological materials such as chemical solvents human cells carcinogenic compounds mutagenic compounds and compounds that have a toxic effect on reproduction laboratory procedures and exposure to blood borne pathogens if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations we could be subject to fines or other sanctions table of contents with other companies engaged in activities similar to ours we face a risk of environmental liability inherent in our current and historical activities including liability relating to releases of or exposure to hazardous or biological materials environmental health and safety laws and regulations are becoming more stringent we may be required to incur substantial expenses in connection with future environmental compliance or remediation activities in which case the production efforts of our third party manufacturers or our development efforts may be interrupted or recent u s tax legislation may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows recently enacted u s tax legislation has significantly changed the u s federal income taxation of u s corporations including by reducing the u s corporate income tax rate limiting interest deductions and revising the rules governing nols many of these changes are effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and internal revenue service or the irs any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation in addition it is unclear how these u s federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities reduction of the corporate tax rate under the legislation may cause a reduction in the economic benefit of our nols and other deferred tax assets available to us furthermore under the legislation although the treatment of tax losses generated before december 31 2017 has generally not changed tax losses generated in calendar year 2018 and beyond will only be able to offset 80 of taxable income this change may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years despite generating a loss for federal income tax purposes in prior years some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we intend to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us we urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation risks related to our intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations under our existing intellectual property license we risk losing the rights to the seminal composition of matter patent we rely upon patents and proprietary technology currently co owned by a subsidiary of horizon therapeutics plc and the u s public health service phs to develop anvs 401 we have an exclusive worldwide license subject to standard reservation of rights under federal law to anvs 401 for its composition of matter its use in ad and dementia its manufacture and its use in down syndrome which allows us to develop and commercialize anvs 401 for those indications the agreement allows us to either pay license fees and royalties on sales to develop and sell anvs 401 or to exercise an option to buy the rights out and own the rights to the compound outright if we do not fulfill the terms of the license horizon may offer these patents to other parties and we will lose the right to develop and commercialize anvs 401 if we do not exercise our option to buy the rights out or our right to terminate the agreement the term of the agreement will continue until the expiration of our obligation to make royalty payments such royalty payments continue for each product in each country until the later of the expiration of the related patent or 10 years after the initial sale of the product in the respective country the agreement may also be terminated for cause by either party upon the breach of the material obligations of the other party or the bankruptcy or liquidation of the other party table of contents if we are unable to maintain patent protection for our technology licensed from horizon or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets we rely upon a combination of patents trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our drug development programs and product candidates our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain maintain and defend patent protection in the united states and other countries with respect to anvs 401 and any future product candidates the patent prosecution process is expensive and time consuming and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner the world wide exclusive license we have with horizon comprises the patents co owned by horizon and the phs the patents have expiration dates between 2021 and 2026 if we are unable to obtain additional patent protection for the applications filed by annovis to prolong the patent life of our compounds we may not be able to continue development of our compounds we seek to protect and prolong our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the united states and abroad related to our development programs and product candidates if the patent applications we own with respect to our development programs and product candidates fail to issue if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for anvs 401 or any future product candidate it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates and threaten our ability to commercialize future product candidates any such outcome could have a materially adverse effect on our business and our company could cease to exist has filed three families of patent applications to prolong the patent life of anvs 401 unless these applications are approved by the u s and international patent offices the patent life of using anvs 401 is limited the first patent application family we filed which would be expected to expire in 2031 covers the use of anvs 401 at much lower doses and expands its use to the treatment of ad pd and other neurodegenerative disorders such as huntington s disease prion diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis tauopathies and frontotemporal dementia based on our preclinical research in august 2019 the u s patent and trademark office granted patent no us 10 383 851 the first of our annovis patents from this family covering parkinson s disease and lewy body diseases the second patent application family covers anvs 405 s use in acute brain and nerve trauma and would be expected to expire in 2036 before any patent term adjustments or extensions the third patent application family relates to the use of the mechanism of action of anvs 401 and anvs 405 to prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases and would be expected to expire in 2038 before any patent term adjustments or extensions the issuance of our new patent gives us some comfort that the patent life relating to methods of using anvs 401 may be prolonged to 2031 the fact that only a portion of the family claims has so far been allowed could result in very limited patent coverage as the patent claims issued thus far are limited to treating pd and lewy body diseases it is possible that we will fail to identify further patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection the patent applications that we own may fail to result in issued patents with claims that provide further coverage of anvs 401 or any other product candidate in the united states or in other foreign countries our patents may be challenged in courts or in patent offices which could result in the invalidation narrowing or unenforceability of our patents and our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours there is no assurance that all the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a table of contents patent application even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents further cover anvs 401 or any future product candidate third parties may challenge their validity enforceability or scope which may result in such patents being narrowed invalidated or held unenforceable any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates that we may develop further if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals the period during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation in addition the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states for example european patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than u s law does however in certain instances the laws of the united states are more restrictive than those of foreign countries for example a recent series of supreme court cases has narrowed the types of subject matter considered eligible for patenting accordingly certain diagnostic methods are considered ineligible for patenting because they are directed to a law of nature further publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag the actual discoveries and patent applications in the united states and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all therefore we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions as a result the issuance scope validity enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products in whole or in part or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship scope validity or enforceability and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the united states and abroad such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed invalidated held unenforceable in whole or in part or reduced in term such a result could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products moreover patents have a limited lifespan in the united states the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed while various extensions may be available the life of a patent is limited without patent protection for our current or future product candidates we may be open to competition from generic versions of such products given the amount of time required for the development testing and regulatory review of new product candidates patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized as a result our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours we may become subject to third parties claims alleging infringement of their patents and proprietary rights or we may need to become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents which could be costly time consuming delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates or put our patents and other proprietary rights at risk our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to develop manufacture market and sell our product candidates without alleged or actual infringement misappropriation or other violation of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties litigation relating to infringement or misappropriation of patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is common including patent infringement lawsuits interferences oppositions table of contents reexamination proceedings before the u s patent and trademark office or uspto and corresponding foreign patent offices the various markets in which we plan to operate are subject to frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights in addition many companies in intellectual property dependent industries including the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have employed intellectual property litigation as a means to gain an advantage over their competitors numerous u s eu and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications which are owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates some claimants may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could in addition patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties may be subject to third party claims including infringement interference or derivation proceedings post grant review and inter partes review before the uspto or similar adversarial proceedings or litigation in other jurisdictions even if we believe third party infringement claims are without merit a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third party patents are valid enforceable and infringed and the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable proceedings challenging our patents or those that we license may also result in our patent claims being invalidated or narrowed in scope similarly if our patents or patent applications are challenged during interference or derivation proceedings a court may hold that a third party is entitled to certain patent ownership rights instead of us further if any third party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our compositions formulations methods of manufacture or methods of treatment prevention or use the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable in addition defending such claims would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages if we are found to be infringing a third party s patent rights if we are found to have infringed such rights willfully the damages may be enhanced and may include attorneys fees further if a patent infringement suit is brought against us or our third party service providers our development manufacturing or sales activities relating to the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit may be delayed or terminated as a result of patent infringement claims or in order to avoid potential infringement claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party which may require us to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms the rights may be nonexclusive which could give our competitors access to the same intellectual property rights if we are unable to enter into a license on acceptable terms we could be prevented from commercializing one or more of our product candidates forced to modify such product candidates or to cease some aspect of our business operations which could harm our business significantly modifying our product candidates to design around third party intellectual property rights may result in significant cost or delay to us and could prove to be technically infeasible any of these events even if we were ultimately to prevail could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business in addition if the breadth or strength of protection provided the patents and patent applications we own or in license is threatened it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license develop or commercialize current or future product candidates we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable in patent litigation in the united states and in europe defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or table of contents unenforceability are commonplace grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements for example lack of eligibility lack of novelty obviousness or non enablement third parties might allege unenforceability of our patents because someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information or made a misleading statement during prosecution the outcome of proceedings involving assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable with respect to the validity of patents for example we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution if a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability we would lose at least part and perhaps all of the patent protection on our product candidates furthermore our patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without infringing on our patents or other intellectual property rights because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation there could also be public announcements of the results of hearings motions or other interim proceedings or developments if securities analysts or investors view these announcements in a negative light the price of our common stock could be adversely affected even if resolved in our favor litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities in addition there could be public announcements of the results of hearings motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors view these announcements in a negative light the price of our common stock could be adversely affected such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities we may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace we may not identify relevant third party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance scope or expiration of a third party patent which might adversely affect our ability to develop manufacture and market our product candidates we cannot guarantee that any of our or our licensors patent searches or analyses including but not limited to the identification of relevant patents the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents are complete or thorough nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third party patent and pending application in the united states europe and elsewhere that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates in any jurisdiction for example in the united states applications filed before november 29 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the united states remain confidential until patents issue patent applications in the united states eu and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date therefore patent applications covering our future product candidates or their manufacture or use may currently be unpublished additionally pending patent applications that have been published can subject to certain limitations be later amended in a manner that could cover our product candidates or the use of our product candidates the scope of a claim is determined by an interpretation of the law the written disclosure in a patent and the patent s prosecution history our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending table of contents may be incorrect which may negatively impact our ability to market our product candidates we may incorrectly determine that our product candidates are not covered by a third party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third party s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the united states the eu or elsewhere that we consider relevant may be incorrect which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates time to time we may identify patents or applications in the same general area as our products and product candidates we may determine these third party patents are irrelevant to our business based on various factors including our interpretation of the scope of the patent claims and our interpretation of when the patent expires if the patents are asserted against us however a court may disagree with our determinations further while we may determine that the scope of claims that will issue from a patent application does not present a risk it is difficult to accurately predict the scope of claims that will issue from a patent application our determination may be incorrect and the issuing patent may be asserted against us we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims if we fail in any such dispute in addition to being forced to pay monetary damages we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing our product candidates we might if possible also be forced to redesign our product candidates so that we no longer infringe on the third party intellectual property rights any of these events even if we were ultimately to prevail could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business changes in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates as is the case with other biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property particularly patents obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries involve both technological complexity and legal complexity therefore obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical patents is costly time consuming and inherently uncertain in addition the america invents act aia which was passed in september 2011 resulted in significant changes to the u s patent system important change introduced by the aia is that as of march 16 2013 the united states transitioned to a first to file system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention a third party that files a patent application in the uspto after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we made the invention before it was made by the third party this will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application but circumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions some of the other changes introduced by the aia are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and provide opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent with the uspto this applies to all of our u s patents even those issued before march 16 2013 because of a lower evidentiary standard in uspto proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in u s federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim a third party could potentially provide evidence in a uspto proceeding sufficient for the uspto to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action a third party may attempt to use the uspto procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action it is not clear what if any impact the aia will have on the operation of our business however the aia and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or our licensors patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our licensors issued patents table of contents additionally the u s supreme court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations in addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained depending on decisions by congress the federal courts and the uspto the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future similarly the complexity and uncertainty of european patent laws has also increased in recent years in addition the european patent system is relatively stringent in the type of amendments that are allowed during prosecution complying with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to obtain new patents in the future that may be important for our business obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non compliance with these requirements periodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the uspto and european and other patent agencies over the lifetime of a patent in addition the uspto and european and other patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural documentary fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process while an inadvertent failure to make payment of such fees or to comply with such provisions can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules there are situations in which such noncompliance will result in the abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application and the partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction non compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits non payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents within prescribed time limits if we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates or if we or our licensors otherwise allow our patents or patent applications to be abandoned or lapse our competitors might be able to enter the market which would hurt our competitive position and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in any indication for which they are approved we enjoy only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world filing prosecuting and defending patents covering our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive competitors may use our and our licensors technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we and our licensors have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the united states or the eu these products may compete with our product candidates and our and our licensors patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing addition we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant the grant proceeding of each national or regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in which applications might in some jurisdictions be refused by the relevant patent offices while granted by others for example unlike other countries china has a heightened requirement for patentability and specifically requires a detailed description of medical uses of a claimed drug furthermore generic drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope validity or enforceability of our or our licensors patents requiring us or our licensors to engage in complex lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings generic drug manufacturers may table of contents for and launch generic versions of our products it is also quite common that depending on the country the scope of patent protection may vary for the same product candidate or technology laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws or rules and regulations in the united states and the eu and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions the legal systems of certain countries particularly certain developing countries do not favor the enforcement of patents trade secrets and other intellectual property protection which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally proceedings to enforce our patent rights in other jurisdictions whether or not successful could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if any may not be commercially meaningful accordingly our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license furthermore while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates accordingly our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets if we or our licensors encounter difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions the value of these rights may be diminished and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions countries also have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties in addition some countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors in these countries the patent owner may have limited remedies which could materially diminish the value of such patent if we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business our competitive position may be impaired if we do not obtain patent term extension in the united states under the hatch waxman act and in foreign countries under similar legislation thereby potentially extending the term of marketing exclusivity for our product candidates our business may be materially harmed patents have a limited lifespan in the united states if all maintenance fees are timely paid the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest u s non provisional filing date various extensions may be available but the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained once the patent life has expired for a product we may be open to competition from competitive medications including generic medications given the amount of time required for the development testing and regulatory review of new product candidates patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized as a result our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours upon the timing duration and conditions of fda marketing approval of our product candidates we may be able to extend the term of a patent covering each product candidate under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 referred to as the hatch waxman amendments and similar legislation in the eu the hatch waxman amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the fda regulatory review process the total table of contents including the extension cannot exceed 14 years following regulatory approval however we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements moreover the length of the extension could be less than we request if we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner as a result our revenue from applicable products could be reduced possibly materially under certain circumstances patent terms covering our products or product candidates may be extended for time spent during the pendency of the patent application in the uspto referred to as patent term adjustment or pta the laws and regulations underlying how the uspto calculates the pta is subject to change and any such pta granted by the uspto could be challenged by a third party if we do not prevail under such a challenge the pta may be reduced or eliminated resulting in a shorter patent term which may negatively impact our ability to exclude competitors because pta added to the term of patents covering pharmaceutical products has particular value our business may be adversely affected if the pta is successfully challenged by a third party and our ability to exclude competitors is reduced or eliminated intellectual property rights do not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage the degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage the following examples are illustrative others may be able to make products that are similar to anvs 401 or our future product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license from others others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or otherwise circumvent any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights we or any of our collaborators might not have been the first to conceive and reduce to practice the inventions covered by the patents or patent applications that we own license or will own or license we or any of our collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of the patents or patent applications that we or they own or have obtained a license or will own or will have obtained a license it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents issued patents that we own may not provide us with any competitive advantage or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by our competitors our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights or in countries where research and development safe harbor laws exist and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets ownership of our patents or patent applications may be challenged by third parties and the patents of third parties or pending or future applications of third parties if issued may have an adverse effect on our business table of contents our reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets which increases the possibility that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and protect other proprietary information we consider proprietary trade secrets or confidential know how and unpatented know how to be important to our business we may rely on trade secrets or confidential know how to protect our technology especially where patent protection is believed by us to be of limited value because we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture anvs 401 and any future product candidates and we expect to collaborate with third parties on the development of anvs 401 and any future product candidates we must at times share trade secrets with them we also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements however trade secrets or confidential know how can be difficult to maintain as confidential protect this type of information against disclosure or appropriation by competitors our policy is to require our employees consultants contractors and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements and if applicable material transfer agreements consulting agreements or other similar agreements with us prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information these agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information including our trade secrets however current or former employees consultants contractors and advisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements given that our proprietary position is based in part on our know how and trade secrets a competitor s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets or confidential know how is expensive time consuming and unpredictable the enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction addition these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors employees third party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets our competitors may discover our trade secrets either through breach of our agreements with third parties independent development or publication of information by any of our third party collaborators a competitor s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business if our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected our unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged infringed circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks we may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names which we need to build name recognition among potential collaborators or customers in our markets of interest at times competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion in addition there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our unregistered trademarks or trade names over the long term if we are unable to successfully register our trademarks and trade names and establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected table of contents efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks trade secrets domain names copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations we may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms a third party may hold intellectual property including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development or commercialization of anvs 401 or our future product candidates it may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize anvs 401 or our product candidates in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could materially harm our business at this time we are unaware of any intellectual property that interferes with ours or is complementary and needed to commercialize anvs 401 we may be subject to claims that our employees consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of their former employers or other third parties we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies although we seek to protect our ownership of intellectual property rights by ensuring that our agreements with our employees collaborators and other third parties with whom we do business include provisions requiring such parties to assign rights in inventions to us we may be subject to claims that we or our employees consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees former employers or other third parties we may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims there is no guarantee of success in defending these claims and if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable intellectual property rights such as exclusive ownership or right to use even if we are successful litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees our proprietary information may be lost or we may suffer security breaches in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property clinical trial data proprietary business information personal data and personally identifiable information of our clinical trial subjects and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions although to our knowledge we have not experienced any such material security breach to date any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information significant regulatory penalties disruption of our operations damage to our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in us and our ability to conduct clinical trials which could adversely affect our reputation and delay our clinical development of our product candidates table of contents risks related to our employees managing our growth and our operations our future success depends on our ability to retain our key personnel and to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we are highly dependent on the development regulatory commercialization and business development expertise of maria l maccecchini phd as well as the other principal members of our management scientific and clinical teams although we have employment agreements offer letters or consulting agreements with our executive officers these agreements do not prevent them from terminating their services at any time we lose one or more of our executive officers or key employees our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed furthermore replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop product candidates gain regulatory approval and commercialize new products competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these additional key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel we also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions in addition we rely on consultants and advisors including scientific and clinical advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy our consultants and advisors may be engaged by entities other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us if we are unable to continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited we expect to expand our development regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities and as a result we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth which could disrupt our operations we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations particularly in the areas of development regulatory affairs and sales and marketing to manage our anticipated future growth we must continue to implement and improve our managerial operational and financial systems expand our facilities or acquire new facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel the expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our we may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business cause dilution to our stockholders or reduce our financial resources in the future we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses products or technologies if we do identify suitable candidates we may not be able to make such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all any acquisitions we make may not strengthen our competitive position and these transactions may be viewed negatively by customers or investors we may decide to incur debt in connection with an acquisition or issue our common stock or other equity securities to the stockholders of the acquired company which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders we could incur losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of the acquired business that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel technologies and operations into our existing business in an effective timely table of contents nondisruptive manner acquisitions may also divert management attention from day to day responsibilities increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for operations and other uses we cannot predict the number timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures our computer systems as well as those of our cros and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses unauthorized access natural disasters including hurricanes terrorism war and telecommunication and electrical failures if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations it could result in a material disruption of our development programs for example the loss of preclinical or clinical trial data from completed ongoing or planned trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of personal confidential or proprietary information we could incur liability and the further development of anvs 401 or any other product candidate could be delayed risks

subject to securities class action litigation in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following a decline in the market price of their securities this risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced significant share price volatility in recent years if we face such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources which could harm our business after this offering our directors executive officers and certain shareholders will continue to own a significant percentage of our common stock and if they choose to act together will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval upon the closing of this offering our directors executive officers and shareholders affiliated with our directors and executive officers will beneficially own approximately 43 6 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock or approximately 42 1 if the underwriters exercise their over allotment option from us in full therefore they will have the ability to substantially influence us through their ownership position for example these holders may be able to control elections of directors amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger sale of assets or other major corporate transaction the interests of these holders may not always coincide with our table of contents interests or the interests of other shareholders and they may act in a manner with which you may not agree or that may not be in the best interests of our other shareholders so long as they continue to own a significant amount of our equity these holders will be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or change their opinion of our common stock our share price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future capital appreciation if any will be your sole source of gain we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock would be your sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock for the foreseeable future see dividend policy for additional information we will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them we will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and our shareholders will not have the opportunity as part of their investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are being used appropriately you may not agree with our decisions and our use of the proceeds may not yield any return on your investment because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use our failure to apply the net proceeds of this offering effectively could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy and we might not be able to yield a significant return if any on our investment of these net proceeds a significant portion of our total outstanding shares is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly even if our business is doing well sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market after this offering or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities of our issued and outstanding common stock all of the shares sold in this offering will be freely transferable without restrictions or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act except for any shares acquired by our affiliates as defined in rule 144 under the securities act the remaining shares outstanding after this offering will be restricted as a result of securities laws lock up agreements or other contractual restrictions that restrict transfers for 180 days or in the case of our directors and officers for 12 months after the date of this prospectus see shares eligible for future sale 151 lock up agreements table of contents if you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering you will incur immediate dilution in the book value of your shares the initial public offering price of our common stock will be substantially higher than the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock therefore if you purchase our common stock in this offering you will pay a price per share of our common stock that substantially exceeds the book value of our tangible assets after subtracting our liabilities based on an initial public offering price of 6 00 per share you will experience immediate dilution of 4 52 per share representing the difference between our net tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering and the initial public offering price further the future exercise of any outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock will cause you to experience additional dilution see dilution we will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices as a public company and particularly after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur previously the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 or sox the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the listing requirements of nyse american and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on u s reporting public companies including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives moreover these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly for example we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified senior management personnel or members for our board of directors in addition these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices pursuant to section 404 of sox or section 404 we will be required to furnish a report by our senior management on our internal control over financial reporting we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm to prepare for eventual compliance with section 404 once we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting which is both costly and challenging in this regard we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting despite our efforts there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe or at all that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by section 404 if we identify one or more material weaknesses it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements we are an emerging growth company and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act or jobs act for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may take advantage of table of contents from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of 1 the last day of the fiscal year a following the fifth anniversary of the closing of this offering b in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1 07 billion or c in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer which means the market value of our common stock held by non affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of our prior second fiscal quarter and 2 the date on which we have issued more than 1 0 billion in non convertible debt during the prior three year period addition under the jobs act emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company which may be beneficial to our stockholders more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws that will become effective upon the closing of this offering may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock thereby depressing the market price of our common stock in addition because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors among other things these provisions include those establishing advance notice bylaw provisions for proposals from stockholders for presentation at annual meetings and forum selection bylaw provisions we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner our restated certificate of incorporation that will become effective upon the closing of this offering specifies that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to table of contents forums and protection against the burdens of multi forum litigation however the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that in connection with any applicable action brought against us a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action our bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders with respect to our company and our directors this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our directors which may discourage meritorious claims from being asserted against us and our directors alternatively if a court were to find this provision of our charter inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations we adopted this provision because we believe it makes it less likely that we will be forced to incur the expense of defending duplicative actions in multiple forums and less likely that plaintiffs attorneys will be able to employ such litigation to coerce us into otherwise unjustified settlements table of contents special note regarding forward looking statements this prospectus contains

anvs 401 in ad ds and pd net proceeds from this offering together with our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our product candidates through

equity securities debt financings working capital lines of credit corporate collaborations or license agreements grant funding interest income earned on invested cash balances or a combination of one

in this prospectus we are in the process of writing a second grant proposal to conduct a follow on study to evaluate the effect of anvs 405 administered to tbi rats at various intervals post injury to determine how long after a tbi we can effectively treat a patient the ongoing study of anvs 301 continues to be funded by the nih and further development of anvs 301 may be funded by future grants expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in license acquire or invest in additional businesses technologies products or assets although currently we have no specific agreements commitments or understandings in this regard as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development table of contents vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development efforts the clinical trials we may commence in the future as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 18 months we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect our use of the net proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in a

paid any cash dividends on our capital stock we intend to retain future earnings if any to finance the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the

for the periods presented below the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with prospectus summary 151 summary financial information selected financial information and the financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus the statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook our expectations regarding our future performance liquidity and capital resources and all other non historical statements in this discussion are forward looking statements and are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to our management actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus particularly in the section entitled risk company overview we are a clinical stage drug platform company addressing neurodegeneration such as alzheimer s disease in down syndrome ad ds alzheimer s disease ad parkinson s disease pd our lead compound anvs 401 is a small molecule administered orally that attacks neurodegeneration by entering the brain and inhibiting the translation of neurotoxic proteins 151 amyloid precursor protein app a b app tau phospho tau tau and a synuclein a syn 151 thereby improving axonal transport human studies in four mci patients have shown that anvs 401 lowered the levels of neurotoxic proteins and inflammatory factors in preclinical studies lower neurotoxic protein levels led to improved axonal transport reduced inflammation lower nerve cell death and improved function is a substantial market affecting over 30 million people worldwide and is expected to grow to over 100 million by 2050 while the market for neurodegeneration is over 100 billion to date there are no disease modifying drugs dmd for any neurodegenerative condition enormous efforts have gone into developing better drugs to treat neurodegeneration and the outcomes have been sobering the results of clinical trials in ad the two ad orphan indications ad ds and early onset familial ad or in pd have not supported the development of successful disease modifying therapies is a small lipophilic molecule that is orally available and readily enters the brain as demonstrated by preclinical pharmacokinetics analyses showing brain concentrations approximately six to eight times higher than plasma concentrations anvs 401 has a mechanism of action that we believe to be unique in that it inhibited the over translation of and therefore reduced the levels of several neurotoxic proteins both in vitro and in vivo including app tau and targeting multiple neurotoxic proteins anvs 401 resembles a combination therapy approach with the added convenience of being a single drug with a single drug target therefore we have worked to understand how anvs 401 is able to inhibit the translation of more than one neurotoxic protein are presently conducting a phase 2a study in ad patients in collaboration with the adcs and plan to initiate a second phase 2a proof of concept study of anvs 401 in the first quarter of 2020 with 50 pd patients we have designed the two phase 2a studies with parexel by applying our understanding of the underlying disease states in neurodegeneration and by measuring not just target but also pathway validation in the spinal fluid of these patients if we are able to show both target and pathway validation in two patient populations we believe that our opportunity for successful phase 3 studies is better than if we merely demonstrated target validation in one patient population have never been profitable and have incurred net losses since inception our net losses were 713 871 and 682 349 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively our net losses table of contents the nine months ended september 30 2019 and 2018 were 789 724 and 545 820 respectively and our accumulated deficit at september 30 2019 was 8 575 772 we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidate because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability financial operations overview the following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in development and clinical studies relating to our product candidate expenses associated with clinical development personnel related expenses such as salaries benefits travel and other related expenses including stock based compensation payments to third party contract research organizations or cros contractor laboratories and independent contractors and depreciation maintenance and other facility related expenses expense all research and development costs as incurred clinical development expenses for our product candidate is a significant component of our current research and development product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development primarily due to increased size and duration of the clinical trials we track and record information regarding external research and development expenses for each study or trial that we conduct from time to time we use third party cros contractor laboratories and independent contractors in clinical studies we recognize the expenses associated with third parties performing these services for us in our clinical studies based on the percentage of each study completed at the end of each reporting period expect that our research and development expenses in 2019 and for the next several years will be higher than in 2018 as a result of increased expenditures for our phase 2a study in ad and the work needed for our expected initiation of our phase 2a study in pd during the first quarter of 2020 these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties regarding timing and cost to completion completion of our clinical development and clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time generally varies according to the type complexity novelty and intended use of our product candidates the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development including among others the number of sites included in the clinical trials the length of time required to enroll suitable patients the size of patient populations participating in the clinical trials the duration of patient follow ups the development stage of the product candidates and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates table of contents to the early stage of our research and development we are unable to determine the duration or completion costs of our development of anvs 401 as a result of the difficulties of forecasting research and development costs of anvs 401 as well as the other uncertainties discussed above we are unable to determine when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and other related costs including stock based compensation for personnel serving in our executive finance accounting legal and human resource functions our general and administrative expenses also include facility and related costs not included in research and development expenses professional fees for legal services including patent related expenses consulting tax and accounting services insurance and general corporate expenses we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase with the continued development and potential commercialization of our product candidate expect that our general and administrative expenses in 2019 and for the next several years will be higher than in 2018 as we increase our headcount we also anticipate increased expenses relating to our operations as a public company including increased costs for the hiring of additional personnel and for payment to outside consultants including lawyers and accountants to comply with additional regulations corporate governance internal control and similar requirements applicable to public companies as well as increased costs for insurance interest income expense net interest income expense consists primarily of interest earned on our money market bank account and interest expense on our convertible debt including amortization of deferred financing fees and debt discount as of december 31 2018 the company had u s federal net operating loss carryforwards of 3 394 475 which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2017 and prior of 2 764 240 will expire beginning 2028 the remaining 630 235 of federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 do not expire but are limited 80 of taxable income in future years these operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 and 2034 december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform legislation tcja this legislation makes significant changes in u s tax law including a reduction in the corporate tax rates changes to net operating loss nol carryforwards and carrybacks and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax the legislation reduced the u s corporate tax rate from the current rate of 34 to 21 as a result of the enacted law the company was required to revalue deferred tax assets and liabilities at the enacted rate this revaluation resulted in a decrease in net deferred tax asset of 335 717 million and a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance against these assets there is no impact to income tax expense the other provisions of the tcja did not have a material impact on the 2018 or 2017 financial statements preliminary estimate of the tcja and the re measurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to the finalization of management s analysis related to certain matters such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the tcja changes to certain estimates and the filing of our tax returns u s treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the tcja may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates we completed the analysis of table of contents 2017 tax act during the fourth quarter of 2018 and had no material changes to the original analysis operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service the irs and may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three year period in excess of 50 as defined under sections 382 and 383 in the internal revenue code this could substantially limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities the amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years critical accounting policies and use of estimates we have based our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to clinical development expenses and stock based compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in note 2 to our audited financial statements appearing at the end of this prospectus we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements research and development expenses we rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and to provide services including data management statistical analysis and electronic compilation once our clinical trials begin at the end of each reporting period we will compare the payments made to each service provider to the estimated progress towards completion of the related project factors that we will consider in preparing these estimates include the number of patients enrolled in studies milestones achieved and other criteria related to the efforts of our vendors these estimates will be subject to change as additional information becomes available depending on the timing of payments to vendors and estimated services provided we will record net prepaid or accrued expenses related to these costs fair value of common stock and stock based compensation we account for grants of stock options to employees and non employees based on their grant date fair value and recognize compensation expense over the vesting periods we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model estimates in our share based compensation valuations are highly complex and subjective table of contents in the absence of a public trading market for our common stock on each grant date we develop an estimate of the fair value of our common stock underlying the option grants once our common stock is publicly traded we will no longer have to estimate the fair value of the common stock rather we will determine the value based on quoted market prices we determined the fair value of our common stock using methodologies approaches and assumptions consistent with the aicpa practice guide valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation and based in part on input from an independent third party valuation firm the two year period ended december 31 2016 we issued an aggregate of 125 701 options with exercise prices of 0 14 per share during the year ended december 31 2017 we issued an additional 154 754 options with exercise prices of 0 14 per share for purposes of recognizing compensation expense in our financial statements we retrospectively estimated the value of the common stock underlying these grants to be 0 36 per share we used the option pricing model opm backsolve method utilizing the series a preferred stock price of 0 50 per share which equates to a conversion price to common stock of 0 70 per share the opm requires the use of assumptions such as the volatility of our stock and the time period until a potential liquidity event we also estimated and applied a discount for the lack of marketability of our stock we determined the value per common share had remained constant during this period because we issued series a preferred stock at 0 50 per share at various dates from december 2014 through october 2016 further our research and development efforts our clinical programs and our stage of development had not progressed significantly over this period april 2018 we issued 123 800 options with exercise prices of 0 25 per share for purposes of recognizing compensation expense in our financial statements we retrospectively estimated the value of the common stock underlying these grants to be 0 85 per share using the probability expected return method pwerm the pwerm requires us to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of potential outcomes such as a sale of annovis an initial public offering or dissolution as well as the timing and estimated proceeds to be received in each scenario we estimated the proceeds to be received based on a market approach utilizing values for the acquisition or initial public offering of comparable public companies we also estimated and applied a discount for the lack of marketability of our stock the increase in the fair value per share of common stock compared to prior grant dates reflected our expectations of progress to be made in our clinical trials in 2018 in addition the increase was consistent with the increase in the price per share of our preferred stock as we issued shares of our series a 1 preferred stock in december 2017 and march 2018 at a price per share of 0 90 which equates to a conversion price to common stock of 1 26 per share results of operations operating expenses were comprised of the following ended september 30 research and development general and administrative table of contents years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by 161 762 or 59 to 111 608 for the year ended december 31 2018 from 273 370 for the year ended december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily the result of a 162 000 decrease in contract research costs general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by 193 267 to 602 329 for the year ended december 31 2018 from 409 063 for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily the result of a 128 000 increase for intellectual property legal costs an increase in consulting costs for legal and business development and an increase in stock based compensation expense nine months ended september 30 2019 and 2018 research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by 84 245 or 86 to 14 074 for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from 98 319 for the nine months ended september 30 2018 the decrease was primarily the result of the completion of a number of studies in 2018 general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by 273 024 or 61 to 720 586 for the nine months ended september 30 2019 from 447 562 for the nine months ended september 30 2018 the increase was primarily the result of an increase in accounting legal and consulting costs liquidity and capital resources since our inception in 2008 we have devoted most of our cash resources to research and development and general and administrative activities we have financed our operations primarily with the proceeds from the sale of common stock convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes to date we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products and we do not anticipate generating any revenues from the sales of products for the foreseeable future we have incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception as of september 30 2019 our principal source of liquidity was our cash which totaled 56 250 equity financings for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 we received net proceeds of 246 449 and 332 495 respectively from the sale of common and redeemable convertible preferred stock for the nine months ended september 30 2019 and 2018 we received proceeds of 0 and 243 649 respectively from the sale of common and redeemable convertible preferred stock we had no debt outstanding during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 in march 2019 we issued an aggregate of 530 000 principal amount of convertible promissory notes which will convert upon the closing of this offering into shares of our common stock at a 20 discount to the public offering price table of contents future capital requirements we expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for at least the next 18 months we believe that these available funds will be sufficient to complete our phase 2a clinical trial for anvs 401 and commence the planning of our phase 3 study in ad ds for this product candidate however it is difficult to predict our spending for our product candidates prior to obtaining fda approval moreover changing circumstances may cause us to expend cash significantly faster than we currently anticipate and we may need to spend more cash than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our expectations regarding future cash requirements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions mergers dispositions joint ventures or investments that we make in the future we have no current understandings agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products businesses or technologies we may need to raise substantial additional capital in order to engage in any of these types of transactions expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates and seek marketing approval and subject to obtaining such approval the eventual commercialization of our product candidates if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates we will incur significant sales marketing and outsourced manufacturing expenses in addition we expect to incur additional expenses to add operational financial and information systems and personnel including personnel to support our planned product commercialization efforts we also expect to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance internal controls and similar requirements applicable to us as a public company following the closing of this offering future use of operating cash and capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors including the following the initiation progress timing costs and results of clinical trials for our product candidates the clinical development plans we establish for our product candidates the number and characteristics of product candidates that we develop or may in license the terms of any collaboration agreements we may choose to execute the outcome timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the dea the fda the ema or other comparable foreign regulatory the cost of filing prosecuting defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights the cost of defending intellectual property disputes including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us costs and timing of the implementation of commercial scale manufacturing activities and the cost of establishing or outsourcing sales marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future operating and capital requirements we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings debt financings collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives we have no committed external sources of funds additional equity or debt financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms if at all table of contents we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities our stockholders will experience dilution debt financing if available would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities years ended december 31 nine months ended statement of cash flows data total net cash provided by used in operating activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018 cash used in operations was 558 609 compared to 537 481 for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase in cash used in operations was primarily the result of the increase in net loss and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expense balances from 2017 expect cash used in operating activities to continue to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to an expected increase in our operating losses associated with ongoing development of our product candidate financing activities cash provided by financing activities was 246 449 during the year ended december 31

attributable to 243 649 from the sale of 270 722 shares of our series a 1 preferred stock and 2 800 from the sale of 14 286 shares of our common stock off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities recent accounting pronouncements in february 2016 the fasb issued its final standard on lease accounting asu no 2016 02 leases topic 842 which superseded topic 840 leases which was further modified in asu no 2018 10 codification improvements to topic 842 leases asu no 2018 11 leases topic 842 targeted improvements and asu no 2019 01 leases topic 842 codification improvements to clarify the implementation guidance the new pronouncement requires the recognition on the balance sheet of right of use assets and lease liabilities for all long term leases including operating leases on the balance sheet the pronouncement requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in an entity classifying leases as a finance or operating leases however unlike current u s gaap which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet asu 2016 02 will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet asu 2016 02 also requires disclosures about the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases these disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements pronouncement is effective for all public business entities for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and for non public business entities with annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted in july 2018 the fasb issued asu no 2018 11 which provides targeted improvements to the new lease standard including an option to apply the transition provisions at its adoption date instead of at the earliest comparative period presented in its financial statements we adopted the new leasing standards using a modified retrospective transition approach to be applied to leases existing as of or entered into after january 1 2019 the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements may 2014 the fasb issued asu 2014 09 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers asu 2014 09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under u s gaap and requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services additionally qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract fasb also issued the following amendments to asu no 2014 09

12 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 151 narrow scope improvements and practical expedients have elected to early adopt asu 2014 09 effective january 1 2017 the standard did not have an impact on our financial statements august 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016 15 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments which provides specific guidance related to eight cash flow classification issues the pronouncement is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 we elected to early adopt the new pronouncement in the first quarter of 2019 such early adoption of asu 2016 15 in the first quarter of 2019 did not have an impact on our financial statements november 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016 18 restricted cash which requires changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be explained on the statement of cash flows by including restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the beginning of period and end of period total cash and cash equivalents shown on the statement of cash flows the pronouncement is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period we elected to early adopt asu 2016 18 the early adoption of asu 2016 18 in the first quarter of 2019 did not have an impact on our financial statements march 2018 the fasb issued asu 2018 5 151 income taxes topic 740 amendments to sec paragraphs pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 this asu provided guidance related to securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 which addresses the accounting implications of the tax act sab 118 allows a company to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date and was effective upon issuance we have analyzed the tax act and in certain areas has made reasonable estimates of the effects on its financial statements and tax disclosures june 2018 the fasb issued asu 2018 07 compensation 151 stock compensation topic 718 improvements to nonemployee share based payment accounting the new guidance expands the scope of topic 718 to include share based payments granted to nonemployees in exchange for goods or services used or consumed in an entity s own operations and supersedes the guidance in asc 505 50 equity based payments to non employees the most significant change resulting from this update is that stock based awards granted to non employees will no longer need to be re measured at fair value at each financial reporting date until performance is complete as these awards will be measured at fair value at the grant date the guidance is effective january 1 2019 with early adoption permitted including in an interim period for which financial statements have not been issued we elected to apply the provisions of this asu in our financial statements effective january 1 2017 august 2018 the fasb issued asu no 2018 13 fair value measurement topic 820 151 disclosure framework 151 changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement the new guidance improves and clarifies the fair value measurement disclosure requirement of asc 820 the new disclosure requirements include the changes in unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income for recurring level 3 fair value measurement held at the end of reporting period and the explicit requirement to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop table of contents unobservable inputs for level 3 fair value measurements the other provisions of asu 2018 13 also include eliminated and modified disclosure requirements the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted including in an interim period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance we have evaluated the impact of adoption of this asu and determined that it will not have a significant impact on our financial statements quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks which may result in potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not believe we are exposed to material market risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents currently have no operations outside the united states but we have contracted with third parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials outside of the united states at this time such manufacturing and research costs are paid for in u s dollars and therefore are not subject to fluctuations in exchange rates if we conduct additional clinical trials outside of the united states in the future we may be required or may choose to pay for those clinical trials in a local foreign currency and could incur foreign currency exchange rate risk do not engage in any hedging activities against changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents we do not believe that an immediate 10 increase in interest rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments on april 5 2012 the jumpstart our business startups act of 2012 or jobs act was signed into law the jobs act contains provisions that among other things reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company as an emerging growth company we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the jobs act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non emerging growth companies section 107 of the jobs act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is to certain conditions set forth in the jobs act as an emerging growth company we are not required to among other things i provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 ii provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non emerging growth public companies under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act iii comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements auditor discussion and analysis and iv disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation these exemptions will apply until the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering or until we no longer meet the requirements for being an emerging growth company whichever occurs first table of contents founders vision we strive to protect nerve cells from dying neurodegenerative diseases impact millions of people including our own families and friends and eventually many of us may be afflicted by one of them research has come a long way in providing better insights into the brain its workings and its shortfalls and our goal is to defeat these diseases by protecting nerve cells from dying and by restoring homeostasis is a great challenge and an even greater opportunity defeating neurodegeneration by preserving nerve cells and their function allows people to age with dignity allows loved ones to enjoy their parents and family members into old age and may help healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed insights into the functioning of the brain and the interaction between nerve cells have given us the tools to look at the toxic cascades at their path of destruction and at how to stop the course we are working hard to engineer medicines that are orally available cross the blood brain barrier and normalize brain homeostasis while we are in clinical stage we have not yet established the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates we will need to obtain regulatory approval after further clinical trials which we cannot assure will be successful however we have been able to show in preclinical and early clinical studies that these drugs can interfere with the toxic cascade at the very beginning and by doing so may slow down or stop the destruction of nerve have assembled what we believe to be an outstanding team and a network of collaborators who are passionate about solving the diseases all leading to neurodegeneration such as alzheimer s disease in down syndrome alzheimer s disease and parkinson s disease main goal is to provide a solution to the problems that patients of neurodegenerative diseases face we are also mindful however of the risks that we will face in this process please join us in our journey as we seek to develop drugs to mitigate the effects of neurodegeneration maria maccecchini ph d ceo and founder jeffrey cummings md chief medical advisor table of contents annovis is a clinical stage drug platform company addressing neurodegeneration such as alzheimer s disease in down syndrome ad ds alzheimer s disease ad and parkinson s disease pd we have an ongoing phase 2a proof of concept study in ad patients and have planned to commence a second phase 2a study in pd patients we are developing our lead compound anvs 401 for chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as ad ds ad and pd in several studies anvs 401 inhibited the synthesis of neurotoxic proteins 151 app a b app tau phospho tau tau and a synuclein a syn 151 that are the main cause of neurodegeneration high levels of neurotoxic proteins lead to impaired axonal transport which is responsible for the communication between and within nerve cells when that communication is impaired the immune system is activated and attacks the nerve cells eventually killing them through our patented product platform we have shown in four mildly cognitive impaired mci patients that anvs 401 lowered the levels of neurotoxic proteins and inflammatory factors in preclinical studies lower neurotoxic protein levels led to improved axonal transport reduced inflammation lower nerve cell death and improved function industry has encountered challenges in targeting specifically one or the other neurotoxic protein be it app tau or a syn indicating that targeting one neurotoxic protein alone does not change the course of neurodegeneration our goal is to develop a disease modifying drug dmd for patients with neurodegeneration by leveraging our clinical and animal evidence in inhibiting at least the three most relevant neurotoxic proteins believe that we are the only company developing a clinical stage proof of concept drug for ad ds ad and pd that inhibits more than one neurotoxic protein and has a mechanism of action designed to restore nerve cell axonal and synaptic activity by improving axonal transport in the brain we expect to treat memory loss and dementia associated with ad ds and ad as well as body and brain function in pd believe that anvs 401 has the potential to be the first drug to interfere with the underlying mechanism of neurodegeneration anvs 401 is a small once a day orally administered brain penetrant inhibitor of neurotoxic proteins the biological activity of anvs 401 has been evaluated in 19 animal studies conducted in leading institutions such as the karolinska institute columbia university and harvard university 16 of the studies are published and three are presently manuscripts in preparation we also conducted three clinical trials with 125 humans including two safety studies in 120 healthy volunteers and a proof of concept study in four mci patients with parexel an international clinical research organization in these studies we showed that anvs 401 was well tolerated and we saw promising clinical signals in all four patients anvs 401 reduced the levels of app tau and a syn a syn is an unpublished not statistically significant observation and lowered inflammatory factors are presently conducting a phase 2a study in ad patients in collaboration with the alzheimer disease cooperative study adcs and plan to initiate a second phase 2a proof of concept study of anvs 401 in the first quarter of 2020 with 50 pd patients the ad study being conducted by adcs is expected to enroll a total of 24 persons at three dose levels plus placebo in a double blind placebo controlled fashion to date the study has enrolled and treated eight early to moderate ad patients under an agreement with uc san diego where adcs is located we have contracted to provide study supplies at our cost the agreement also contains standard indemnification and confidentiality provisions and may be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice we have designed the two phase 2a studies with parexel by applying our understanding of the underlying disease states in neurodegeneration and by measuring not just target but also pathway validation in the spinal fluid of these patients this means that we are proposing to measure as many factors as possible associated with the toxic cascade precipitated by impaired axonal transport if we are able to show both target and table of contents validation in two patient populations we believe that our opportunity for successful phase 3 studies is better than if we merely demonstrated target validation in one patient believe that ad and pd are two of the largest medical needs of the aging u s population and two potentially large markets once a dmd has been developed and approved therefore we desire to demonstrate anvs 401 s efficacy in both indications however since ad studies are very large and time and capital consuming we plan to focus on an orphan population that is substantially similar to ad but in a very controlled and limited setting we intend to focus on ad in the ds population because in ds the app gene is triplicated leading to early onset ad with similar pathology as sporadic ad in our animal studies in ds mice lowering their high levels of app improved axonal transport in the brain and increased memory and learning as described on page 89 in accordance with this animal data we expect that lowering levels of app tau and a syn in ds human patients will lead to an improvement in their memory cognition and dementia conducting the study in ad ds patients instead of ad patients will allow us to obtain human data for ad in an orphan subpopulation much faster than in the regular ad population concomitantly our goal is to also conduct a phase 3 pivotal study in early pd patients by the end of 2024 we expect to have conducted two pivotal studies for anvs 401 one in ad ds and one in pd and to have filed one or two new drug applications nda with the u s food and drug administration fda landscape of drug development for alzheimer s drugs drug development for ad has proven to be very difficult five drugs are approved for the treatment of ad including four cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine donepezil rivastigmine galantamine and an n methyl d aspartate receptor antagonist memantine no new treatments have been approved for ad since 2003 while these drugs ameliorate the symptoms the ultimate aim is the development of disease modifying therapies dmt that stop or slow the progression of ad 2003 over 500 clinical studies have been completed and no compound has shown efficacy ad drug candidates have the highest failure rate of 100 compared to 50 to 80 for other indications among the dmts the most common pathway has been to target amyloid beta as dictated by the amyloid hypothesis all studies attacking a b to date have failed but since a b accumulates years before the symptoms of ad are visible there is a movement in the industry toward treating patients with milder forms of ad including cognitively normal individuals with evidence of amyloid pathology in spinal fluid or by amyloid positron emission tomography pet or who have genetic profiles that place them at high risk for developing ad these approaches have missed their endpoints as shown by the very recent discontinuations of the roche acimmune and the biogen eisai studies to date over 40 billion have been spent on dead end approaches have all dmd approaches failed to date in 1906 alois alzheimer opened the brain of a woman that had died with severe dementia and he found plaques tangles and brain shrinkage he called the condition alzheimer s disease today we are still calling this condition ad however what alois alzheimer found was the end stage removing plaques and tangles does not restore the brains vigor communication system and homeostasis is the beginning of neurodegeneration it starts out with high levels of neurotoxic proteins that cause impairments in axonal transport our pipeline consists of anvs 401 for chronic neurodegeneration 151 including ad its orphan indication ad ds and pd anvs 405 to treat acute neurodegeneration 151 traumatic brain injury tbi and stroke 151 and anvs 301 for advanced ad table of contents our lead compound anvs 401 is an orally administered drug being developed for chronic indications such as ad ds ad and pd because in preclinical studies it improved axonal transport in these diseases by inhibiting the overproduction of neurotoxic proteins that kill nerve cells the compound was tested in three phase 1 clinical studies that showed it to be well tolerated this safety data is applicable to the clinical development of anvs 401 for ad ds ad pd and other chronic neurodegenerative disorders for acute indications we are developing anvs 405 focused on protecting the brain after tbi and or stroke anvs 405 is the same compound as anvs 401 but it is given intravenously in cases of acute head and brain trauma anvs 405 was given to rats as an injectable after tbi to ensure that it would reach the brain in less than 15 minutes rather than 1 5 hours tbi rats that were treated with anvs 405 after the insult exhibited enhanced memory and learning and lower microglia activation a measure of inflammation to date the program has been funded by a grant from the us army and we plan to seek additional grant funding to further the development of anvs 405 for acute indications of brain and nerve trauma we plan to conduct a follow on study to evaluate the effect of anvs 405 administered to tbi rats at various intervals post injury to determine how long after a tbi we can effectively treat a patient we would then seek further funding to conduct the toxicology and pharmacokinetics pk studies in animals file the initial new drug application ind conduct the safety and pk studies in humans and continue with phase 2 and phase 3 efficacy studies we are developing our compound anvs 301 to increase cognitive capability in later stages of ad and dementia anvs 301 improved memory and learning in very old rats by lowering the number of errors from six to three and shortening run times from approximately 75 to approximately 28 seconds anvs 301 is in a phase 1 clinical trial that is being conducted and financed by the national institutes of health nih the single ascending dose study is nearly complete and we in collaboration with the nih are preparing to move into the multiple ascending dose study when the single and multiple ascending dose safety studies are complete we will review the data and decide whether to pursue the indication of advanced ad background 151 what is neurodegeneration a normal nerve cell receives signals processes them in the cell body and transports them through the axon a long arm nerve fiber that extends out from the cell body and connects to the synapses or fingers these fingers then touch the successive nerve cell s where the signals are relayed further table of contents nerve cell with axon and synapse brain cells become injured or stressed their first response is reduction and impairment of axonal transport if the insult persists axonal vesicle transport remains impaired resulting in decreased levels of neurotransmitters and leading to depression serotonin anxiety and insomnia gaba ad acetylcholine and pd dopamine it also results in lower levels of neurotrophic factors and in nerve cells getting sick when the immune system sees a sick cell it attempts to remove it which leads to inflammation in the brain eventually the sick cell is then killed by the immune system anvs 401 151 our solution to reverse neurodegeneration anvs 401 is a small lipophilic molecule that is orally available and readily enters the brain as demonstrated by preclinical pharmacokinetics analyses showing brain concentrations approximately six to eight times higher than plasma concentrations in different studies we found slightly different ratios because of the time of measurement after administration on average brain levels are approximately six to eight times higher than plasma concentrations anvs 401 showed a mechanism of action we believe to be unique in that it inhibited the over translation of and therefore reduced the levels of several key neurotoxic proteins both in vitro and in vivo including app tau and a syn three phase 1 clinical studies demonstrated that anvs 401 was well tolerated the third proof of concept study showed that it also reduced levels of app tau and a syn a syn is an unpublished not stastically significant observation in the cerebrospinal fluid csf of four mci patients additionally we now have preclinical data that linked the lowering of neurotoxic proteins to axonal transport improvement and restoration of function by lowering the levels of neurotoxic proteins in ad transgenic tg and ds trisomic mice models anvs 401 increased memory and learning anvs 401 also improved colonic motility in a pd tg mouse model of pd see pages 89 90 targeting multiple neurotoxic proteins anvs 401 resembles a combination therapy approach with the added convenience of being a single drug with a single drug target therefore we have worked to understand how anvs 401 is able to inhibit the translation of more than one neurotoxic protein table of contents novel mechanism of action and target engagement we undertook an extensive exploration of the mechanism of action of anvs 401 on app and a syn synthesis and we concluded that anvs 401 specifically inhibits translation of mrnas coding for neurotoxic proteins only using 5 different methods we obtained overlapping results in vitro mrnas of neurotoxic proteins have a conserved stem loop in the 5 untranslated region 5 utr called an iron response element ire type ii stem loop these ires bind to an rna binding protein specifically to iron regulatory protein 1 irp1 when the mrnas are bound they are not translated when the iron levels in the cytoplasm go up irp1 releases its mrnas and they are translated target engagement in these in vitro studies anvs 401 specifically bound to the ire irp1 complex of mrnas coding for neurotoxic proteins and inhibited the release of the mrnas under high iron conditions it did not bind to ire irp1 complexes of mrnas coding for iron carrying or shuttling proteins such as ferritin transferring or ferroportin or other protein mrnas app ire irp1 anvs 401 kd 3 2 nm table of contents ferritin ire irp1 anvs 401 no kd binds to the app ire irp1 complex but not to the ferritin ire irp1 complex the 5 utr ire is highly conserved among the mrnas of neurotoxic proteins we believe anvs 401 can inhibit the translation of several neurotoxic proteins by having just one binding site and by increasing the binding of that conserved ire to irp1 under high iron conditions see graph below we have data showing that homologous ire type ii loops are also present in the 5 utr of mrnas that code for app and a syn as well as for other neurotoxic proteins tau prion protein prp and huntingtin htt furthermore we have binding data confirming the interaction of irp1 with the ires from human app a syn tau prp and htt not shown finally our data shows that anvs 401 only increases the binding of ires of neurotoxic proteins to irp1 under stress conditions so it does not affect healthy tissue and does not affect other proteins whose mrnas form a different kind of ire stem loop e g ferritin discussed above anvs 401 inhibited over expression of neurotoxic proteins by binding to the ire irp1 complex and preventing the opening of irp1 and concomitant release of the mrnas under high iron conditions table of contents axonal transport and pathway engagement app tau and a syn impair axonal transport and synaptic transmission causing inflammation forming aggregates and finally leading to nerve cell death through several studies discussed below we have found that by reducing app tau and a syn levels anvs 401 treatment improved axonal transport and impeded the toxic cascade which leads to nerve cell death is being developed for chronic indications as an oral administered drug anvs 405 is the same compound as anvs 401 but it is given intravenously in cases of acute head and brain trauma both modes of administration have shown in animal studies that they lower neurotoxic proteins and inflammation the difference between anvs 401 and 405 is not in their mode of action or activity but in their mode of administration kinetics and dose our pharmacokinetic studies show that in rats table of contents anvs 405 enters the brain in less than 15 minutes while oral anvs 401 takes approximately 1 5 hours our dosing studies in rats show that the dose of injectable form is about seven times lower than the oral form accordingly we expect their toxicology profiles to be different with anvs 405 very likely showing adverse events at much lower doses than anvs 401 anvs 401 has been tested in mouse rat and dog toxicology studies as well as in human safety studies for one month anvs 405 was given to rats as an injectable but for humans it first needs to be formulated into an injectable and the safety must be established in two animal species and in humans before we can study it in human tbi or stroke patients pathway engagement studies showed that anvs 401 lowered levels of neurotoxic proteins and improved function ad tg mice 151 lowered levels of app and its fragments and improved memory learning and brain function the ad tg mice on placebo never learned to find their way in the 7 arm water maze with less than three to four mistakes whereas the anvs 401 treated mice found their way with one mistake ds trisomic mice 151 lowered levels of app and recovered memory and learning the trisomic mice moved 38 less and made 63 more mistakes in the maze than healthy wild type mice anvs 401 increased activity and reduced mistakes of ds trisomic mice pd tg mice 151 lowered levels of a syn in the brain and gut and regulated gut motility the pd tg mice at four months had four times slower and at seven months had seven times slower gut motility than healthy wild type mice anvs 401 improved colonic motility mci patients 151 in four patients lowered levels of app and tau stastically significantly a syn showed a downward trend studies showed that anvs 401 improved retrograde and anterograde axonal transport ds trisomic mice nerve cells 151 in studies conducted at ucsd inhibition of app levels led to restoration of anterograde and retrograde vesicle transport anvs 401 treatment of the ds nerve cells resulted in an increase in transport velocity of 70 anvs 401 also decreased the pause time by 29 this was measured in vitro in isolated fully differentiated ds nerve cells studies showed that anvs 401 increased synaptic transmission in ad tg mice 151 a columbia university study showed that the ad tg mice treated with anvs 401 had similar long term potentiation as healthy wild type mice whereas long term potentiation of the placebo treated ad tg mice was markedly reduced studies showed that anvs 401 increased levels of neurogenesis ad tg mice brains 151 two studies by the karolinska institute measured stem cell and nerve cell differentiation one study found that anvs 401 treatment increased stem cell differentiation into nerve cells by 40 in the hippocampus the second study showed that while the data was variable and dependent on age of the mice and area of the brain treatment with anvs 401 improved synaptic function by modulating the maturation and plasticity of newborn neurons studies showed that anvs 401 and or anvs 405 lowered inflammation in mci patients 151 in a proof of concept clinical trial all four mci patients treated with anvs 401 showed a reduction in inflammatory factors tbi rats 151 rats with traumatic brain injury had much larger microglia than normal rats enlarged microglia means that the microglia are activated and shows inflammation tbi rats treated with anvs 405 had smaller microglia showing lower inflammation table of contents studies showed that anvs 405 protected nerve cells in tbi rats 151 a ucla study stained the rat substantia nigra with a fluorescent probe this probe th immunoreactivity binds to live cells while dead cells do not stain therefore the fluorescent signal is a surrogate marker for live cells rats were subjected to either tbi or to a sham i e mock surgery non tbi rats tbi rats treated with a placebo showed approximately 40 less fluorescence than non tbi rats while tbi rats treated with anvs 405 showed fluorescence of 100 or more as compared to retina rats 151 in a hershey medical center unpublished study that mimics acute glaucoma in which saline was injected into one eye to increase the pressure which kills retinal cells anvs 405 protected 67 of the retina lowering levels of neurotoxic proteins anvs 401 and anvs 405 improved functions in all animal models we tested these functions are memory learning and long term potentiation in ad mice memory learning and axonal transport in ds mice gut and gait function in pd mice memory and learning in tbi rats and sight in acute glaucoma rats we believe these effects make anvs 401 a very promising drug for the treatment of memory loss and dementia in ad ds and ad and bodily and brain functions in pd our goal in our phase 2a studies in ad and pd patients is to demonstrate that anvs 401 is well tolerated and is able to lower the csf levels of neurotoxic proteins at least app tau and a syn and inflammatory markers as previously seen in clinical and preclinical studies in these studies we are also planning to analyze the csf levels for additional neurotoxic proteins control proteins lacking the conserved mrna sequence of neurotoxic proteins as well as neurotransmitters neurotrophic factors degeneration markers and cognitive outcomes thus we expect that we will be able to identify biomarkers for use in later studies anvs 401 151 how was it discovered anvs 401 is a small orally available molecule that readily passes the blood brain barrier and reaches high brain levels was synthesized and invented by dr nigel greig at the national institute on aging nia of the national institutes of health nih which is a part of the u s public health service phs originally dr greig set out to make a better acetylcholinesterase inhibitor achei similar to aricept but better he discovered over 500 analogs of physostigmine and chose phenserine as the best achei phenserine had an affinity for ache of 22 nm and was an improvement over aricept with 900 nm axonyx inc licensed phenserine and developed it as an achei through three phase 3 studies that all failed even though a potent achei phenserine had caused severe vomiting also synthesized a group of analogs that had no acetylcholinesterase activity which were of no importance to him at that time ten years later a friend of his debomoy lahiri told him that he had developed a phenotypic screen for app inhibition and dr greig gave him all his compounds both those with and without achei activity it turned out that the group that had no achei activity did inhibit app in the screen as it looked like the analogs had similar affinity for app inhibition dr greig chose anvs 401 the positive enantiomer of phenserine as the lead compound patented the new group of compounds and licensed them to axonyx inc he published extensively and patented his inventions conducted preclinical toxicology studies in three animal species mice rats and dogs conducted pharmacokinetic studies and pharmacodynamic studies in several animal species manufactured adequate amounts of gmp material and filed an ind with the fda in 2006 phenserine failed and axonyx merged with torreypines therapeutics inc which merged with raptor table of contents pharmaceuticals inc in 2009 raptor pharmaceuticals was acquired by horizon therapeutics plc in 2016 currently the technology is co owned by a subsidiary of horizon and the phs and annovis has exclusive worldwide rights to the technology summary the 150 enantiomers including phenserine are symptomatic acheis whereas the enantiomers including anvs 401 have no achei activity and inhibit the translation of neurotoxic proteins such as app a b tau p tau and a syn and protect nerve cells from dying they are expected to be dmds and change the course of neurodegeneration toxicology studies which were completed in mice rats and dogs lasted 30 days with 30 days of animal safety data we can treat humans whether healthy volunteers or patients for 30 days for us to conduct a two year clinical study the fda requires the completion of two animal toxicology studies 151 a six month study in rats and a nine month study in dogs the successful completion of those toxicology studies is a prerequisite for us to start our planned phase 3 studies in ad ds and pd clinical human data three clinical studies have been conducted with anvs 401 clinical studies with single and repeated daily oral administration of anvs 401 tartrate showed anvs 401 to be well tolerated up to doses of 80 mg once a day or 60 mg four times a day a single dose of 160 mg was associated with an increased incidence of nausea and vomiting so higher doses were not tested anvs 401 is not an ache inhibitor but its n 1 dimethyl metabolite 10 20 has some ache inhibitor activity and may be responsible for these observations the only consistent adverse events aes seen were dizziness fainting and headaches these effects were seen to varying degrees at all doses of anvs 401 and in the placebo group there were no serious aes in any of the clinical studies key findings from the three clinical studies are highlighted below single ascending dose sad in 72 healthy volunteers including placebo 151 drug determined to be well tolerated with no aes at 80 mg with a maximum tolerated dose mtd of 160 mg 151 dose limiting toxicity was nausea multiple ascending doses mad in 48 healthy volunteers including placebo 151 drug determined to be well tolerated with no aes and no symptoms indicative of inhibition of either acetyl or butyryl cholinesterase at doses up to 240 mg day 60 mg four times a day proof of concept poc in four mci patients 151 concentrations of anvs 401 in the brain extrapolated from blood and csf were eight times higher than in plasma 151 anvs 401 lowered csf levels of neurotoxic proteins and inflammatory markers see pages 94 and 95 the four mci patients anvs 401 had a half life of five hours in plasma and more than 12 hours in csf the longer concentration and persistence of anvs 401 in the brain suggest that much lower doses of drug administered once daily could achieve the desired pharmacodynamic effect t max was 1 3 150 1 6 hours post dose independent of dose and comparable for both sexes in plasma and csf anvs 401 is stable orally available and enters the brain therefore we are developing it as an oral drug candidate table of contents summary of safety in humans anvs 401 s pattern of aes was similar to that seen in typical studies in healthy volunteers with an overall incidence of 33 3 among placebo treated subjects and 35 for all anvs 401 treatment groups combined in the single ascending dose study the group given the highest dose of 160 mg day showed 31 7 aes that were treatment related in the multiple ascending dose and in the poc study there was no dose response to the adverse events most aes were of short duration mild or moderate in severity resolved without medical intervention and occurred in one or a few subjects only two subjects experienced severe aes including symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension one placebo and one anvs 401 20 mg subject adverse events seen in the first human sad study conducted with anvs 401 table of contents adverse events seen in the second and third human mad and poc studies conducted with anvs 401 in the human poc study four patients with mci were treated for 10 days with anvs 401 with a dose of 60 mg four times a day 240 mg day which we knew from our mad study to be a well tolerated level csf and plasma were drawn over 12 hours on day 0 before any administration of anvs 401 and on day 11 after the last administration of anvs 401 during each 12 hour period a total of nine csf samples were taken and levels of anvs 401 and metabolites were measured in plasma and csf at all time points pharmacokinetics pharmacokinetics pk in plasma corresponded to what we had seen in the previous clinical safety studies a half life of five hours in csf however anvs 401 showed a much longer half life of over 12 hours we conducted an identical experiment in rats where it is possible to measure the pk of anvs 401 in plasma csf and brain by taking the human plasma csf and rat plasma csf brain levels we were able to extrapolate to the human brain levels and calculate them to be eight times higher than plasma levels this is consistent with the data we have in mice where in several studies anvs 401 levels were found to be approximately six to eight times higher in brain than in plasma extended presence in the brain is matched by an extended effect reducing levels of app tau and a syn for the whole period tested 12 hours the extended effect of anvs 401 in the four human patients was consistent with the preclinical data in rodent brains persistence of anvs 401 in the csf and brain and the extended pharmacodynamic effect observed make anvs 401 a good candidate for once a day dosing extrapolated brain levels of anvs 401 at 60 mg four times a day were far in excess of levels we believe are required to down regulate app and a syn the doses of anvs 401 needed to lower the levels of neurotoxic proteins are similar for the toxic proteins suggesting similar dosing in ad ad ds and pd we further compared anvs 401 brain levels of mice that showed improved memory learning and colonic motility and calculated that the optimum brain levels measured were between 150 and 500 nm using three different extrapolation comparison calculations we calculated that a daily dose of 5mg to 60 mg should achieve potentially desired brain levels in humans table of contents pharmacodynamics pharmacodynamics was performed on the same 18 csf samples taken from each person as above since we had data for four patients with 18 time points each it was possible to conduct statistical analysis of the data using a repeated measure mixed model analysis of variance the p value represents the probability that the difference between compared groups is due to chance rather than drug effect and when that probability is less than 5 or p 60 0 05 the result is considered statistically significant fda evidentiary standards for drug approval require that the trial design must permit a valid comparison with a control group to permit a quantitative assessment of the effect of the drug which may include demonstration of statistical csf biomarkers decrease after 10 days of oral anvs 401 in four mci patients human biomarker unpublished results mci patients showed high levels of sapp tau and a syn in their csf they were treated for 10 days with anvs 401 and their csf was analyzed for neurotoxic proteins in all four patients the levels of neurotoxic proteins decreased the percentages shown in the table were calculated using all nine time points after treatment compared to all nine time points prior to treatment due to the variability in the csf measurements of sapp a sapp b a b 42 and tau we had all samples analyzed by two different laboratories using different same csf samples were also analyzed for inflammatory factors and microglia activation factors as well as a control factor all patients reacted by lowering their levels of inflammatory markers and not lowering the level of the control protein statistical analysis again was performed with a repeated measure mixed model analysis of variance three inflammatory markers were lowered to a statistically significant level complement c3 mcp 1 and ykl 40 the fourth inflammatory marker scd14 showed a downward trend we also measured factor fh a complement regulatory protein involved in blood clotting which served as our control factor as we had expected factor fh was not downregulated by anvs 401 csf inflammatory markers after 10 days of oral anvs 401 in four mci patients human inflammatory protein table of contents mci patients also showed high levels of inflammatory factors and microglia activation factors in their csf anvs 401 statistically significantly lowered the levels of three inflammatory markers in all four patients comparison with healthy volunteers then compared the levels found in four healthy volunteers with the levels seen in the four mci patients before and after 10 days of anvs 401 administration the heathy volunteers did not go through the entire study as did the mci patients they gave one csf sample taken by lumbar puncture in the morning and that sample was only used to measure sapp a sapp b and tau order to make the comparison as accurate as possible we used a single measurement from the same time point in each of the mornings of day 0 and day 11 for each mci patient because this was similar to the timing for the healthy volunteers in this very limited comparison we were able to show that all four patients experienced a decrease in sapp a sapp b and tau these reductions brought the average levels of sapp a sapp b and tau in the treated mci patients close to the average levels we measured in healthy volunteers table of contents the tables above show the csf levels of sapp a sapp b and tau in the four mci patients and the four healthy volunteers the percentages in the bar diagrams are derived from each of the tables with red representing average of mci patients at day 0 before anvs 401 treatment green representing average of mci patients at day 11 after 10 days of anvs 401 treatment and blue representing average of untreated healthy volunteers the average of mci patients at day 0 was considered the base at 100 we then calculated the averages of mci patients at day 11 and the healthy volunteers as a percentage of the preclinical animal studies by inhibiting the overexpression of neurotoxic proteins anvs 401 improved or prevented the symptoms associated with chronic as well as acute neurodegeneration in several animal models the data most relevant to the present application are shown table of contents app ps1 tg mouse model of ad anvs 401 improved spatial working memory as shown in a 2 day radial arm water maze test in this mouse ad model at a 25 mg kg oral dose p 0 0033 figure below top and showed a dose response at 10 mg kg oral dose in the same study anvs 401 improved synaptic function and long term potentiation in hippocampal slices at both doses in a dose dependent fashion figure below bottom anvs 401 treatment did not affect wild type wt

recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials 150 fepsp between shaffer collateral and pyramidal neurons from ca1 stratum radiatum is shown on trisomic mouse model of ad ds ds trisomic mice display several abnormal behaviors reminiscent of ad including memory loss they have elevated levels of app that has been shown in mice to contribute to deficient memory and learning cognitive impairment as well as dementia ds trisomic mice are used as a model for ad because they exhibit similar deficits as seen in ad thus we considered whether anvs 401 could re establish healthy behavior in these mice like that seen in wild type mice we measured the rate of table of contents alternations in a y maze and found that the alternation rate is significantly lower in ds trisomic mice versus wild type mice reflecting impaired working memory while anvs 401 treatment increased alternation rate in ds trisomic mice it had no obvious effects in wild type mice we also found an effect on the exploratory activity reflected by the number of arm entries again reflecting impaired working memory all ds trisomic mice treated with anvs 401 displayed improved working memory to a variable extent ds trisomic mice were tested for correct alternations into a y maze and they made 38 less alternations p 0 005 left above at the same time they made 63 more entries into the maze p 0 01 left than wild type mice anvs 401 treatment improved working memory deficit in ds trisomic mice mobley laboratory ucsd manuscript in preparation snca a53t and snca a30p mouse models of pd we used these pd tg mice as models of early gastrointestinal dysfunction which is common in pd patients and precedes the onset of motor symptoms by many years to decades untreated pd tg mice resemble pre parkinson s patients showing symptoms of constipation by three months of age here we assessed the colonic motility by measuring the time required to expel a glass bead inserted into the colon at four and seven months of age anvs 401 statistically significantly p 0 034 at four months and p 0 0001 at seven months decreased the bead expulsion time between anvs 401 treated and placebo treated mice thus it improved the colonic motility of pd tg mice figure below furthermore even after we stopped treatment for nine weeks the constipation was still reduced data not shown anvs 401 does not act as a laxative since when given to two different control mice breeds that do not develop constipation snca and snca ib ib it does not affect their gut motility table of contents snca a53t and snca a30p mice producing human mutant a syn associated with familial pd were treated intraperitoneally with vehicle or anvs 401 beginning at six weeks up to seven months of age anvs 401 prevented the impaired gut motility of the snca a53t and snca a30p mice at 3 and 10 mg kg older mice demonstrate a more severe phenotype that nonetheless responded to anvs 401 tbi causes severe cognitive and neurological impairment which can incapacitate the patient reduce quality of life and increase the risk of morbidity and mortality tbi is known to increase the risk for neurodegenerative disorders such as ad and pd several studies have analyzed changes in the brain after tbi and identified up regulation of neurotoxic proteins such as app tau and a syn received a 1 5 million grant from the us army to study the effect of anvs 405 in blunting the damage caused by tbi in rats our partnering pi dr marie francoise chesselet and her collaborator dr david hovda at ucla have used different rat models to study the behavioral biochemical and neuropathological consequences of tbi as well as to identify potential drug treatments our study manuscript in preparation rats were subjected to either fluid percussion injury fpi or sham operation to one side of the brain three different anvs 405 doses or saline were given intraperitoneally to rats subjected to fpi for four weeks with the first dose administered one hour post injury at the termination of the treatment all the rats were first tested for their performance in the water maze and then they were sacrificed for brain staining of living cells and determination of microglia activation as shown 10 mg kg anvs 405 improved memory and learning as measured by water maze performance figure below left furthermore sections of the brain were stained with tyrosine hydroxylase th wherein th stains only live cells the amounts of th immunoreactivity in the whole striatum of the brain slices were measured the rats treated with all three doses of anvs 405 showed higher th staining in the ipsilateral area of the brain than the vehicle treated animals figure below right thus anvs 405 protects the striatum following fpi in rats table of contents effects of anvs

microglial activation was assessed by quantitative measurement of the diameter of iba 1 positive cells ionized calcium adaptor binding protein microglia with cell body diameters less than 5 micro m had a resting morphology characterized by multiple ramified processes hyper ramified microglia partially activated microglia had a mean cell body diameter of 5 6 m m fully activated amoeboid microglia had a mean cell body diameter of 7 14 m m anvs 405 increases the number of resting microglia and reduces the number of activated microglia effect of 10mg kg anvs 405 on microgilial activation effect of treatment with 10mg kg anvs 405 on microglial activation following fpi in rats these data show anvs 401 and anvs 405 reduced the toxic effects of neurotoxic proteins in vivo in several animal models of both chronic and acute neurodegeneration reproducible results across species 151 mouse rat human as mentioned lowered levels of app tau and a syn have been shown in spinal fluid of humans treated with anvs 401 in the human poc study as well as in brains of mice in ad tg mice ds trisomic mice and pd tg mice and rats treated with anvs 405 in the tbi study reduced inflammation has been shown in spinal fluid of four humans treated with anvs 401 in the human poc study and in brains of rats treated with anvs 405 in the tbi study table of contents as discussed anvs 401 and 405 have a mechanism of action we believe to be unique that allows them to inhibit the over translation of and reduce the levels of app tau and a syn which play a central role in the pathogenesis of both ad and pd that in combination with our supporting data showing results in ad ds ad and pd mouse models and lowering of the toxic effects of neurotoxic proteins leads us to believe that anvs 401 is a promising drug for the treatment of both diseases therefore our approach is innovative in that we do not have a single therapeutic target for a single disease instead we have one drug that targets the conserved ire element of the mrnas of multiple neurotoxic proteins applicable to multiple diseases with a potential market for neurodegenerative diseases estimated at more than 100 billion annually most pharma companies have a program studying some aspect of nerve and brain degeneration none of these approaches have resulted in a drug that improves cognition some newer approaches target tau whose expression is more closely associated with cognitive decline similarly for pd several companies are trying to inhibit a syn so far neither drugs attacking tau nor a syn have been tested in phase 3 hence there is an enormous need for a different disease modifying strategy there is more than one neurotoxic protein in the brain of ad and of pd patients and the same neurotoxic proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of ad and pd in fact a significant portion of ad patients brains display mixed pd pathology and vice versa therefore just attacking one of these proteins may result in no or lower efficacy than attacking them all we are unaware of any other person or entity that is working on inhibiting more than one neurotoxic protein and tackling more than one neurodegenerative disorder at the same time to prove that this approach is possible we want to study the effects of anvs 401 on the levels of several neurotoxic proteins and other surrogate markers in parallel in ad and pd patients within 18 to 24 months we believe we will have two phase 2a studies one in ad and one in pd patients alzheimer s disease associated with down syndrome 151 ad ds market ds or trisomy 21 is one of the most common causes of intellectual disability and recent national prevalence estimates suggest that 13 65 per 10 000 live births are infants with ds leading to 5 429 on average annual ds births in the united states worldwide the occurrence of ds is about four to five times that life expectancy has increased dramatically for children with ds born in 2010 median life expectancy is estimated to be 65 years however along with this longer lifespan comes the prospect of a considerable increase in the risk of developing dementia associated with ad with a prevalence of nearly 80 for those with ds who are older than 65 years in comparison non ds individuals have a risk of 40 to 50 by the time they are 90 years old like in sporadic ad there is a prodromal or asymptomatic phase in ds when ad pathology progressively accumulates 30 40 years but clinical signs of dementia may be delayed by up to a decade this provides a therapeutic window or an opportunity for prevention that is unique to adults with down syndrome ad ds is an orphan indication with similar symptoms to sporadic ad but in a much younger population with accelerated disease progression the us ad ds is an orphan indication because about 50 000 ds people have ad and about 120 000 are at risk to develop ad in the next 5 to 10 years parallel with the age dependent increased risk for developing dementia virtually all adults with ds over the age of 40 years have sufficient plaques and tangles for a neuropathologically based diagnosis of ad because trisomy 21 leads to the overexpression of app between the ages of 30 and 40 years neuropathology rapidly accumulates until it reaches levels sufficient for a diagnosis of ad by 40 years and there is an acceleration phase to disease development table of contents alzheimer s disease market ad is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive functional and behavioral alterations ad is age related and its incidence is increasing with the aging of the population it is estimated that currently 44 million victims of ad dementia exist in the world and by 2050 more than 100 million people worldwide will be living with ad nearly eightfold as many people have preclinical ad as have symptomatic ad and are at risk for progressing to manifest disease dmts that will prevent or delay the onset or slow the progression of ad are urgently needed a modest one year delay in onset by 2020 would result in there being 9 2 million fewer cases in 2050 similarly medications to effectively improve cognition or ameliorate neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients in the symptomatic phases of ad are needed to improve memory and behavior increase in incidence of ad with the aging of the population is becoming increasingly common as the global population ages and as the health system in developing countries gets better we urgently need to identify drugs that prevent delay the onset slow the progression or improve the symptoms of ad parkinson s disease market pd is also a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with movement and non movement symptoms functional behavioral and cognitive alterations pd like ad is age related and is becoming markedly more common with the aging of the world s population pd affects about 1 of the population over the age of 60 while in individuals over the age of 85 this prevalence reaches 5 highlighting the impact that advancing age has on the risk of developing this condition affects about 10 million people worldwide of which over one million are in the us there are 60 000 new cases of pd diagnosed each year in the us the incidence is expected to double by 2040 national parkinson s foundation estimates that the economic burden of pd is at least 25 billion a year in the united states date there are no available treatments capable of curing pd with current therapies seeking only to ameliorate dopamine related motor symptoms of the disease no treatments to date address non motor symptoms there is a clear and unmet medical need for new dmts that can slow or prevent pd progression mixed pathologies market in addition to the unmet need of ad and pd patients approximately 50 of patients exhibit mixed pathologies with some pathologies resembling ad and some resembling pd these patients table of contents are not addressed at all by the drugs presently in development for ad or pd because these drugs target only one or the other neurotoxic protein is increasingly being recognized in cases of pd such cases are termed pd dementia pdd the spread of fibrillar a syn pathology from the brainstem to limbic and neocortical structures seems to be the strongest neuropathological correlate of emerging dementia in pd up to 50 of patients with pdd develop sufficient numbers of a b plaques and tau containing neurofibrillary tangles for a secondary diagnosis of alzheimer s disease and these pathologies may act synergistically with a syn pathology to confer a worse prognosis study looking at the incidence of mixed pathologies diagnosed community dwelling older persons those with dementia most often have multiple brain pathologies which greatly increases the odds of dementia specifically in people with dementia over 50 had multiple diagnoses ad pd lewy body dementia pdd or infarcts after accounting for age persons with multiple diagnoses were almost three times more likely to exhibit dementia compared to those with one pathologic diagnosis therapy that only addresses a b tau or a syn won t help people with mixed pathologies since anvs 401 inhibits more than one neurotoxic protein it is possible that by halting the cascade of toxic proteins it might stop or slow ad pd and mixed pathology diseases at all stages of development approaches and competition alzheimer s disease in orphan indications there are two orphan indications that represent ad one is ad in down syndrome ad ds and the other is early onset familial ad eofad date very little work has been done in these indications roche genentech ac immune are conducting one study in eofad in a colombian extended family and ac immune is working on a vaccine for ad ds anti a b antibody phase 3 study in colombian eofad in 2012 genentech a roche company initiated the first ever study of cognitively healthy individuals who are likely to develop alzheimer s disease due to their genetic history the landmark trial is the first to assess the potential of an investigational medicine to stop alzheimer s before it starts the study involves a humanized monoclonal antibody made by ac immune which is designed to bind to a b the main constituent of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with ad a b is proposed to be causative in the development of the disease prevention trial may provide the most effective test to date of the amyloid hypothesis two groups of patients totaling as many as 324 people are involved in the study they live in colombia which is home to nearly 5 000 people who share the risk for a rare genetic mutation this mutation presenilin 1 causes early onset ad in any individual who is a carrier in the trial are 30 or older and within 15 years of the age when their parent s symptoms began typically mild cognitive impairment due to ad begins in these colombian families around 45 the study is ongoing and moving slower than expected so we do not know when the data is due anti a b vaccine phase 1b study for ad ds ac immune has completed recruitment for the high dose cohort of the aci 24 phase 1b study for the treatment of ad like characteristics in adults with ds the first low dose and the second high dose cohorts have been fully recruited in august 2017 and in july 2018 respectively and the primary outcome is expected in 2020 in addition to cognitive dysfunction beginning in childhood individuals table of contents ds are genetically predisposed to develop a b related cognitive decline at a much younger age and with much greater probability than the general population immune is expected to start the phase 2 study with aci 24 in ds patients with mild ad the aim of this double blind randomized placebo controlled study with an adaptive design is to assess the safety tolerability immunogenicity target engagement biomarkers and clinical efficacy of aci 24 the trial will seek to confirm the positive trends on a b pet imaging and clinical measurement cdr sb deg of the previous phase 1 safety study the phase 2 trial will be conducted in several european countries alzheimer s disease approaches drug development for ad has proven to be very difficult five drugs are approved for the treatment of ad including four cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine donepezil rivastigmine galantamine and an n methyl d aspartate receptor antagonist memantine no new treatments have been approved for ad since 2003 many failures in ad drug development have occurred with both small molecules and immunotherapies failing to show a drug placebo difference or having unacceptable toxicity clinicaltrials gov is a public website that lists all clinical trials conducted or recruiting today there are a total of 112 agents in the pipeline as shown on clinicaltrials gov among the dmts most addressed amyloid targets a b accumulates for years before the symptoms of ad are visible some pharmaceutical companies are testing their drugs earlier including cognitively normal people or those who have genetic profiles that place them at high risk for developing ad table below in phase 3 there were six prevention trials enrolling cognitively normal participants and 12 trials of

mutation douglas mental health university family history of ad emory university parental history of ad table of contents increasing number of agents are directed at tau related targets neurofibrillary tangles are one of two major pathological hallmarks of ad correlation studies conducted by braak and braak demonstrating that neurofibrillary tangle burden more closely correlates with cognitive decline than amyloid plaque load tau remains an important but largely untested target for disease modification in ad the first anti tau programs were directed at reducing tau aggregation the preliminary results of these studies were largely disappointing and agents directed against tau aggregation are being re evaluated summary at present there are no disease modifying agents on the market the first large effort to develop a dmd for ad has targeted a b 42 but all a b 42 approaches to date have failed a few companies are moving to fighting tau and a lot of companies have pulled out of ad research and are waiting to see what approach might have a better outcome since the ad brain contains several neurotoxic proteins 151 amyloid precursor protein and its toxic fragments a b 42 and ic99 a well as tau and a syn 151 a dmd drug needs to target more than just one toxic protein to be efficacious we believe that anvs 401 is the only drug that satisfies this criterion concerning observation derived from this ad pipeline review is the lack of agents targeting the moderate to advanced stages of ad only 26 trials permit inclusion of participants with mini mental state exam scores of 14 or less and only 12 include participants with scores of 10 or less together these studies intend to enroll only 1 720 participants with over 15 million people affected by ad dementia worldwide there is an urgent need to develop more effective symptomatic treatments for moderate to advanced stage disease the paucity of agents directed at this population represents a significant weakness of the ad drug development pipeline parkinson s disease approaches levodopa l dopa was introduced for use in treating pd more than 40 years ago and remains the mainstay of therapy for improving the symptoms of the disease unlike dopamine which cannot cross the blood 151 brain barrier l dopa is effectively absorbed into the brain where it metabolizes into dopamine it is typically administered five times a day and works well in controlling symptoms for one to five years unfortunately the effects of l dopa in any patient diminish with time are several other drugs available to treat pd which also seek to modulate dopamine levels commonly prescribed dopamine agonists that directly activate dopamine receptors include agents such as mirapex pramipexole bi and requip ropinirole glaxosmithkline drug therapy is common in pd for instance the use of other drug classes such as the catechol o methyltransferase inhibitors and the monoamine oxidase mao inhibitors allow patients to reduce l dopa dosing levels several mao inhibitors are approved for pd therapy including zelapar selegiline valeant and azilect rasagiline teva lundbeck 2012 the market for pd drugs was about 2 3 billion worldwide despite high volume generics the most important current therapy for pd l dopa is prescribed as a generic while volume growth in the category is expected to remain healthy dollar growth will likely remain relatively flat as some of the category s larger brands requip mirapex contend with generic inroads the size of the current market reflects the absence of innovative branded therapies more than it does the medical need disease modifying compounds targeting a syn for the treatment of pd in clinical trials far all products are at early stages of clinical development and no

drugs have shown potential neuroprotective ability in preclinical studies demonstrating these effects in clinical studies remains a challenge beyond drug therapies a few cell and gene therapy approaches are also being explored progress across these newer technology platforms has been slow a notable failure in the cell therapy area was spheramine bayer titan a cell therapy in which human retinal cells were injected into the brain to directly produce l dopa in the brain which did not meet its primary and secondary endpoints in a phase 2b study concluded in 2008 table of contents more recently neuroprotective development efforts have switched to gene therapies targets in the gene therapy area include neurturin which is a naturally occurring protein that is known to repair damaged and dying dopaminergic neurons glutamic acid decarboxylase which alleviates abnormal brain activity associated with the motor deficits that characterize pd and aromatic l amino acid decarboxylase tyrosine hydroxylase and gtp cyclohydrolase 1 which naturally control dopamine levels in the brain by reprogramming transduced cells to manufacture and secrete dopamine on this front has also been frustrating ceregene s cere 120 which was an adeno associated virus vector carrying the gene neurturin failed in a recently reported phase 2 trial ceregene was recently acquired by sangamo which

patent no us 10 383 851 the first of our annovis patents from this family covering pd and associated diseases patent portfolio licensed from horizon relating to our product candidate anvs 401 includes three patent families and more specifically the first of these patent families relates to a composition of matter for anvs 401 tartrate a method of inhibiting production of amyloid precursor protein and a method of treating ad and dementia via the administration of anvs 401 and 257 analogs this patent family includes granted patents in the united states europe australia and canada we expect patents in this family to expire in 2022 the second of these patent families relates to a process for producing the two enantiomers 150 phenserine and phenserine anvs 401 from physostigmine compounds by hydrolysis to form an eseroline compound which is then condensed with an isocyanate this patent family table of contents granted patents in the united states europe canada and south korea we expect

patent family includes two granted patents in the united states we expect patents in this family to expire in 2025 and 2026 patent and patent application portfolio invented and filed by annovis relating to anvs 401 and anvs 405 includes three patent families and more specifically claims the first of these patent families relates to a method of reducing the amount of a neurotoxic protein in a human s by administering a pharmaceutical composition which includes anvs 401 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an amount which is surprisingly less than previously reported and administered on a once a day basis this patent family includes patent applications pending in the united states europe japan canada and south korea if granted we expect patents in this family to expire in 2032 in non u s jurisdictions and in 2031 in the united states this patent family covers ad and pd as well as huntington s disease prion diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis tauopathies and frontotemporal dementia in august 2019 the u s patent and trademark office granted patent no us 10 383 851 the first of our annovis patents from this family covering pd and associated diseases we are filing one or more continuation applications in order to capture further patentable subject matter in this application while the notice of allowance gives us some comfort that the patent life of anvs 401 may be prolonged to 2031 the fact that only a portion of the application family claims has so far been allowed could result in very limited patent coverage and the constraint of our development efforts to pd alone it is further possible that we will fail to identify further patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent the second of these patent families relates to a method of treating or preventing acute brain or nerve injury in humans in need of such treatment via the administration of an effective amount of anvs 405 the acute brain or nerve injury may be traumatic brain injury stroke microinfarcts post operative cognitive decline resulting from anesthesia or surgery induced inflammation or acute brain injury induced by brain ischemia insufficient oxygen supply to the brain anoxia or hypoxia concussion drowning whip lash bicycle crashes automobile accidents shaken baby syndrome falling physical impact of the head or acute angle closure glaucoma this patent family includes patent applications pending in the united states and an international application under the patent cooperation treaty which will allow national phase applications to be filed in a broad list of foreign member countries if granted we expect patents in this family to expire in 2036 the third of these patent families relates to a method of restoring heavy metal homeostasis to a healthy human or restoring heavy metal homeostasis in a sick human patient comprising chronically administering anvs 401 in a therapeutically effective amount to maintain heavy metal homeostasis in the healthy human patient or restore heavy metal homeostasis in the sick human patient the sick human patient may be e g suffering from a neurodegenerative disease such as ad or pd or a cancerous disease or condition a cardiovascular disease or a disease of a vital organ this patent family further relates to the surprising fact that anvs 401 may prevent control delay or slow the onset of such diseases by maintaining heavy metal homeostasis further annovis has now recognized that while heavy metal dis homeostasis is responsible for neurodegenerative disorders such as ad in other conditions cells of the human patient can be stressed e g have high heavy metal concentrations such as iron and react with cardiovascular diseases or conditions of vital organ failure these diseases may be prevented controlled delayed or slowed by the chronic administration of effective amounts of anvs 401 table of contents maintain heavy metal homeostasis this patent family includes patent applications pending in the united states australia canada china europe hong kong and japan if granted we expect patents in this family to expire in 2038 patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained generally patents issued for regularly filed applications in the united states are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non provisional filing date in addition in certain instances a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the u s patent and trademark office or uspto delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the fda regulatory review period however as to the fda component the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following fda approval the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date however the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis from country to country and depends upon many factors including the type of patent the scope of its coverage the availability of regulatory related extensions the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent we rely upon trade secrets and know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position we seek to protect our proprietary information in part using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and

competitors to the extent that our collaborators employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties it is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies or our drugs or processes obtain licenses or cease certain activities our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us if third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to march 16 2013

anvs 401 is approved for ad or pd we plan to enter into sales and marketing agreements with one or several pharmaceutical companies to sell to neurologists geriatric specialists and to primary care physicians anvs 401 is a small molecule that is manufactured using a 4 step patented process we rely on third party contractors for manufacturing clinical supplies and plan to do so for commercial amounts also presently we are working with an overseas supplier for the manufacture of the cgmp api and with a local supplier for the storage stability encapsulating blister packing blinding and distribution of the capsules or pills to the clinical sites government regulation the fda and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development manufacture marketing and distribution of drugs such as those we are developing these agencies and other federal state and local entities regulate among other things the research and development testing manufacture quality control safety effectiveness labeling storage record keeping approval advertising and promotion distribution post approval monitoring and reporting sampling and export and import of our product candidates table of contents u s government regulation of drug products in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and its implementing regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable u s requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as the fda s refusal to approve pending ndas withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold issuance of warning letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties process required by the fda before a drug may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following completion of preclinical laboratory tests animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the fda s good laboratory practice or glp regulations submission to the fda of an ind which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin approval by an independent institutional review board or irb at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice or gcp requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication submission to the fda of an nda satisfactory completion of an fda advisory committee review if applicable satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice or cgmp requirements and to assure that the facilities methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug s identity strength quality and purity satisfactory completion of fda audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with gcps and the integrity of the clinical data payment of user fees and securing fda approval of the nda compliance with any post approval requirements including the potential requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or rems and the potential requirement to conduct post approval studies preclinical studies preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy an ind sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests together with manufacturing information analytical data and any available clinical data or literature among other things to the fda as part of an ind some preclinical testing may continue even after the ind is submitted an ind automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the fda unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold in such a case the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin as a result submission of an ind may not result in the fda allowing clinical trials to initiate table of contents clinical trials clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with gcp requirements which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing among other things the objectives of the trial the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind in addition an irb at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the nih for public dissemination on their www clinicaltrials gov website clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap or be combined phase 1 the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety dosage tolerance absorption metabolism distribution excretion and if possible to gain an early indication of its effectiveness phase 2 the drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage phase 3 the drug is administered to an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in well controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval to establish the overall risk benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the fda and more frequently if serious adverse events occur phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period or at all furthermore the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk similarly an irb can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the irb s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients marketing approval assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing the results of the preclinical and clinical studies together with detailed information relating to the product s chemistry manufacture controls and proposed labeling among other things are submitted to the fda as part of an nda requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications in most cases the submission of an nda is subject to a substantial application user fee under the prescription drug user fee act or pdufa guidelines that are currently in effect the fda has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard nda for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission this review typically takes twelve months from the date the nda is submitted to fda because the fda has approximately two months to make a filing decision table of contents in addition under the pediatric research equity act of 2003 or prea as amended and reauthorized certain ndas or supplements to an nda must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective the fda may on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements an agreed initial pediatric study plan requesting a waiver from the requirement to conduct clinical studies has been submitted to the fda fda also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or rems plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks the rems plan could include medication guides physician communication plans assessment plans and or elements to assure safe use such as restricted distribution methods patient registries or other risk minimization tools fda conducts a preliminary review of all ndas within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review the fda may request additional information rather than accept an nda for filing in this event the application must be resubmitted with the additional information the resubmitted application is also subject to review before the fda accepts it for filing once the submission is accepted for filing the fda begins an in depth substantive review the fda reviews an nda to determine among other things whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured processed packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product s continued safety quality and purity fda may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts including clinicians and other scientific experts which reviews evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions the fda is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions approving an nda the fda typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured the fda will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cgmp requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications additionally before approving an nda the fda may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with gcp requirements evaluating the nda and all related information including the advisory committee recommendation if any and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites the fda may issue an approval letter or in some cases a complete response letter a complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the fda to reconsider the application even with submission of this additional information the fda ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval if and when those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction the fda will typically issue an approval letter an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications if the fda approves a product it may limit the approved indications for use of the product require that contraindications warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling require that post approval studies including phase 4 clinical trials be conducted to further assess a drug s safety after approval require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a rems which can materially affect the potential market and table of contents of the product the fda may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post marketing studies or surveillance programs after approval some types of changes to the approved product such as adding new indications manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims are subject to further testing requirements and fda review and approval special fda expedited review and approval programs the fda has various programs including fast track designation accelerated approval priority review and breakthrough therapy designation which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and fda review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs the purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard fda review procedures be eligible for a fast track designation the fda must determine based on the request of a sponsor that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need the fda will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors the fda may review sections of the nda for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the nda the fda agrees to accept sections of the nda and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the nda fda may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists a priority review means that the goal for the fda to review an application is six months rather than the standard review of ten months under current pdufa guidelines under the current pdufa agreement these six and ten month review periods are measured from the filing date rather than the receipt date for ndas for new molecular entities which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review addition products tested for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality imm that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on imm or other clinical benefit taking into account the severity rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments as a condition of approval the fda may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on imm or other clinical endpoint and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures under the provisions of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act or fdasia passed in july 2012 a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy a breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval the fda must take certain actions such as holding timely meetings and table of contents advice intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy at the completion of our two phase 2 trials one in pd and one in ad annovis will petition the fda to classify anvs 401 as a breakthrough therapy if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs the fda may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for fda review or approval will not be shortened we may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate accelerated approval pathway the fda may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug influences a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit the fda may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on imm and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on imm or other clinical benefit taking into account the severity rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval the purposes of accelerated approval a surrogate endpoint is a marker such as a laboratory measurement radiographic image physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints an intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug such as an effect on imm the fda has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly thus accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor s agreement to conduct in a diligent manner additional post approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug s clinical benefit as a result a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post marketing compliance requirements including the completion of phase 4 or post approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint failure to conduct required post approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post marketing studies would allow the fda to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis all promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the fda orphan drug designation and exclusivity under the orphan drug act the fda may designate a drug product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200 000 individuals in the united states or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the table of contents of developing and making a drug product available in the united states for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product a company must request orphan product designation before submitting an nda if the request is granted the fda will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process a product with orphan status receives the first fda approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity orphan product exclusivity means that the fda may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years except in certain limited circumstances if a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application it may not be entitled to exclusivity orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand further the fda may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease if the products contain different active ingredients moreover competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity post approval requirements drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to fda approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda including among other things requirements relating to recordkeeping periodic reporting product sampling and distribution advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product after approval most changes to the approved product such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior fda review and approval there are continuing annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products fda may impose a number of post approval requirements as a condition of approval of an nda for example the fda may require post marketing testing including phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product s safety and effectiveness after commercialization addition drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the fda and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and these state agencies for compliance with cgmp requirements changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior fda approval before being implemented fda regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cgmp requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance an approval of a drug or medical device is granted the fda may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information imposition of post market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or table of contents of distribution or other restrictions under a rems program other potential consequences include among other things restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls fines warning letters or holds on post approval clinical trials refusal of the fda to approve pending ndas or supplements to approved ndas or suspension or revocation of product approvals product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties fda strictly regulates marketing labeling advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability u s coverage and reimbursement significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of our product candidate anvs 401 or any other for which we may seek regulatory approval sales in the u s will depend in part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors which include government health programs such as medicare medicaid tricare and the veterans administration as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge reduction or denial by payors process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all the fda approved products for a particular indication also third party payors may refuse to include a branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available medicare part d medicare s outpatient prescription drug benefit contains protections to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oral oncology products and all part d prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all oral anti cancer agents however a payor s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations sales of anvs 401 or any other product candidates will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third party payors achieving favorable coverage and reimbursement from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and or the medicare administrative contractors is typically a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy in order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing we may need to conduct studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of any products which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals third party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost effective compared to other available therapies or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield table of contents adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development u s healthcare fraud and abuse laws and compliance requirements we are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws may impact among other things our proposed sales and marketing programs in addition we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our operations include the federal anti kickback statute which prohibits among other things persons from soliciting receiving offering or paying remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind to induce or reward or in return for either the referral of an individual for or the purchase order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws including the federal civil false claims act which prohibits anyone from among other things knowingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to federal programs including medicare and medicaid claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent provisions of hipaa which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other things knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services in addition hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act and its implementing regulations impose certain requirements relating to the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and the federal physician payment sunshine act requirements under the patient protection and affordable care act which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to cms payments and other transfers of value they make to u s physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer regulation outside the united states to the extent that any of our product candidates once approved are sold in a foreign country we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations which may include for instance applicable post marketing requirements including safety surveillance anti fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals market our future products in the eea which is comprised of the 28 member states of the eu plus norway iceland and liechtenstein and many other foreign jurisdictions we must obtain separate regulatory approvals more concretely in the eea medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization or ma there are two types of marketing authorizations the community ma which is issued by the european commission through the centralized procedure based on the opinion of the committee for medicinal products for human use of the european medicines agency or ema and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the eea the centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products such as biotechnology medicinal products orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of aids cancer neurodegenerative disorders diabetes auto immune and table of contents the centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the eea or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the eu and national mas which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the eea and only cover their respective territory are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the eea this national ma can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure if the product has not received a national ma in any member state at the time of application it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure the above described procedures before granting the ma the ema or the competent authorities of the member states of the eea assess the risk benefit balance of the product based on scientific criteria concerning its quality safety and efficacy data and marketing exclusivity in the eea new products authorized for marketing or reference products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the eu during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the eu the market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the eu until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the eu the 10 year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if during the first eight years of those 10 years the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies orphan drug designation in the eea a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the eu when the application is made or that the product is intended for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of a life threatening seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the eu and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the eu would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in development for either of these conditions the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the eu or if such method exists the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition the eea an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten year period of market exclusivity during this market exclusivity period the ema or the member state competent authorities cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization or grant a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product for the same indication the period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed pip period may however be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation for example because the table of contents is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases such as consent from the marketing authorization holder inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product demonstration of clinical superiority by a similar medicinal product or after a review by the committee for orphan medicinal products requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply medicinal products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for incentives made available by the eu and its member states to support research into and the development and availability of orphan drugs as of january 20 2020 we had 2 employees our offices are in berwyn pennsylvania where we have leased and have access to 1 500 square feet of office space we believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs legal proceedings from time to time we may be involved in claims that arise during the ordinary course of business although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently have any pending litigation to which we are a party or to which our property is subject that we believe to be material regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly and time consuming and it can divert management s attention from important business

experience in substantive matters pertaining to our business relative to other board members and diversity of background and perspective including but not limited to with respect to age gender race place of residence and specialized experience table of contents board leadership structure role of the board in risk oversight one of the key functions of our board of directors is informed oversight of our risk management process our board of directors does not have a standing risk management committee but rather administers this oversight function directly through our board of directors as a whole as well as through various standing committees of our board of directors that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight in particular our board of directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure and our audit committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken our audit committee also monitors compliance with

certificate of incorporation and bylaws some provisions of delaware law our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws that will be in effect upon the consummation of this offering could make the following transactions more difficult an acquisition of us by means of a tender offer an acquisition of us by means of a proxy contest or otherwise or the removal of our incumbent officers and directors it is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests including transactions which provide for payment of a premium over the market price for our shares provisions summarized below are intended to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids these provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors we believe that the benefits of the increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of authorized but unissued shares our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval these additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes including future public offerings to raise additional capital and corporate acquisitions the existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain

annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent requirements for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals stockholders seeking to present proposals

deemed to be interested stockholders from engaging in a business combination with a publicly held delaware corporation for three years following the date these persons become interested stockholders

interested stockholder is a person who together with affiliates and associates owns or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own 15 or more of a corporation s voting stock generally a business combination includes a merger asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder the existence of this provision may have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors choice of forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum in which we and our directors may be sued by our stockholders to the fullest extent permitted by law for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and

liability created by the securities act or the exchange act or any other claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims alternatively if a court were to find either choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition advance notice requirements our bylaws establish an advance

stockholder s intention to bring that business before the meeting although our bylaws do not give the board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting our bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are

engaged in for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the securities while the offering is in progress over allotment transactions involve sales by the underwriters of securities in excess of the number of securities that underwriters are obligated to purchase this creates a syndicate short position which may be either a covered short position or a naked short position in a covered short position the number of securities over allotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of securities that they may purchase in the over allotment option in a naked short position the number of securities involved is greater than the number of securities in the over allotment option the underwriters may close out any short position by exercising their over allotment option and or purchasing securities in the open market covering transactions involve purchases of securities in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions in determining the source of securities to close out the short position the underwriters will consider among other things the price of securities available for purchase in the open market as compared with the price at which they may purchase securities through exercise of the over allotment option if the underwriters sell more securities than could be covered by exercise of the over allotment option and therefore have a naked short position the position can be closed out only by buying securities in the open market a naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that after pricing there could be downward pressure on the price of the securities in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in

that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period due to the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the financial statements actual results may materially vary from these items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the valuation of equity based compensation and contingent liabilities future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty accordingly accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment accounting estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes c basic and diluted earnings loss per share basic net loss per share is determined using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period diluted net income per share includes the effect if any from the potential exercise or conversion of securities such as redeemable convertible preferred stock and stock options which would result in the issuance of incremental shares of common stock the computation of diluted net loss per shares does not include the conversion of securities that would have an anti dilutive effect the basic and dilutive computations of net loss per share for the company are the same because the dilutive effects of the company s convertible securities would be anti dilutive d cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents at times the

outstanding payables to cros g share based compensation share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period the company early adopted asu 2018 07 on january 1 2017 which permits the valuation of stock based awards granted to non employees to be measured at fair value at the grant date rather than on an accelerated attribution basis over the vesting period the appropriate fair value of share based awards requires the use of subjective assumptions including the fair value of the company s common shares and for options the expected life of the option and expected share price volatility the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value its option awards the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent management s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment as a result if factors change and management uses different assumptions share based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards expected life of options was estimated using the simplified method as the company has limited historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post vesting employment h income taxes
